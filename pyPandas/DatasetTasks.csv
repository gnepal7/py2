"1013","55","3757755","05/30/2020 22:48:37","Project Introduction
In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, there was a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives. In this project, you will play detective, and put your new skills to use by building a person of interest identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal. To assist you in your detective work, we've combined this data with a hand-generated list of persons of interest in the fraud case, which means individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement, or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity.

Resources Needed

You should have python and sklearn running on your computer, as well as the starter code (both python scripts and the Enron dataset) that you downloaded as part of the first mini-project in the Intro to Machine Learning course. The starter code can be found in the final_project directory of the codebase that you downloaded for use with the mini-projects. Some relevant files:

poi_id.py : starter code for the POI identifier, you will write your analysis here

final_project_dataset.pkl : the dataset for the project, more details below

tester.py : when you turn in your analysis for evaluation by a Udacity evaluator, you will submit the algorithm, dataset and list of features that you use (these are created automatically in poi_id.py). The evaluator will then use this code to test your result, to make sure we see performance that’s similar to what you report. You don’t need to do anything with this code, but we provide it for transparency and for your reference.

emails_by_address : this directory contains many text files, each of which contains all the messages to or from a particular email address. It is for your reference, if you want to create more advanced features based on the details of the emails dataset.
 
Can be found here:-https://www.kaggle.com/sagarnildass/enron-person-of-interest-dataset

Steps to Success

We will provide you with starter code, that reads in the data, takes your features of choice, then puts them into a numpy array, which is the input form that most sklearn functions assume. Your job is to engineer the features, pick and tune an algorithm, test, and evaluate your identifier. Several of the mini-projects were designed with this final project in mind, so be on the lookout for ways to use the work you’ve already done.

The features in the data fall into three major types, namely financial features, email features and POI labels.

    financial features: ['salary', 'deferral_payments', 'total_payments', 'loan_advances', 'bonus', 'restricted_stock_deferred', 'deferred_income', 'total_stock_value', 'expenses', 'exercised_stock_options', 'other', 'long_term_incentive', 'restricted_stock', 'director_fees'] (all units are in US dollars)
    email features: ['to_messages', 'email_address', 'from_poi_to_this_person', 'from_messages', 'from_this_person_to_poi', 'shared_receipt_with_poi'] (units are generally number of emails messages; notable exception is ‘email_address’, which is a text string)
    POI label: [‘poi’] (boolean, represented as integer)

You are encouraged to make, transform or rescale new features from the starter features. If you do this, you should store the new feature to my_dataset, and if you use the new feature in the final algorithm, you should also add the feature name to my_feature_list, so your coach can access it during testing. For a concrete example of a new feature that you could add to the dataset, refer to the lesson on Feature Selection.

Project Evaulation Instructions

When you're finished, your project will have 2 parts: the code/classifier you create and some written documentation of your work. Share your project with others and self-evaluate your project according to the rubric here.(https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/27/view)

Before you start working on the project: Review the final project rubric carefully. Think about the following questions - How will you incorporate each of the rubric criterion into your project? Why are these aspects important? What is your strategy to ensure that your project “meets specifications” in the given criteria? Once you are convinced that you understand each part of the rubric, please start working on your project. Remember to refer to the rubric often to ensure that you are on the right track. 

When making your classifier, you will create three pickle files (my_dataset.pkl, my_classifier.pkl, my_feature_list.pkl). The project evaluator will test these using the tester.py script. You are encouraged to use this script before checking to gauge if your performance is good enough.

Evaluation:- Submission of notebook file in the name format:- username_accuracy.ipynb.
Note:- In the notebook file you will be calling functions or your own code and evaluating and displaying accuracy from the .pkl files.","","Building a person of interest identifier based on email data.","POI Indentifier.","","20"

This dataset contains data for over 400,000 flights from 19 carriers and 284 airports from October to December 2008. We'll start by reading in and lightly cleaning the data. Then we'll do some data exploration by making plenty of figures and tables that give us a clearer idea of what is in this dataset. Once we feel more comfortable with the dataset, we will try some machine learning to predict flight cancellations and delay times. We find that cancellation predictions are not feasible with the given data. Combining this with current weather and aircraft/airport maintenance data could make cancellation predictions somewhat useful. Predicting flight delay times is similarly difficult and could also be improved with relevant real-time data. Even though this dataset is not particularly useful for predictions, there are nonetheless interesting relationships and distributions that can be shown.","","Airplane Delay & Cancellation","","","8"

Create a calculator that allows the simulation of Pokemon battles that matches the standard calculations for battles as they happen in the game.

### Expected Submission
Provide a notebook that allows users to select which pokemon and moves they would like to battle and then allows the battle to come to completion.

### Evaluation

An accurate and easy to use simulator is the ideal solution. A couple of stretch goals:

- How are moves selected to be used each turn? Random or AI selection? Allowing user input?
- Allow for two teams of pokemon to be defined and go up against each other
- Automatically generate pokemon teams to battle
- Simulate multiple battles with different moves chosen each time, after hundreds of runs what is the percentage of times each pokemon beats each other?
- Run a tournament with all of the pokemon in the game, which are the strongest relative to each other?","","Create a Pokemon Battle Simulator","","","1"

All solutions should contain the correlation between the factors you discovered and the happiness score of this dataset (I'm looking for the actual number). Any charts explaining this correlation will also help.

### Evaluation
This is highly subjective. The best solutions will both have a good correlation score, but are also creative and explain the work well.","","What makes people in a country happy?","Join any data you want to explain why countries are ranked as they are here","01/31/2020 00:00:00","78"

Quoting from ProPublica:
""
Black defendants were often predicted to be at a higher risk of recidivism than they actually were. Our analysis found that black defendants who did not recidivate over a two-year period were nearly twice as likely to be misclassified as higher risk compared to their white counterparts (45 percent vs. 23 percent).
White defendants were often predicted to be less risky than they were. Our analysis found that white defendants who re-offended within the next two years were mistakenly labeled low risk almost twice as often as black re-offenders (48 percent vs. 28 percent).
The analysis also showed that even when controlling for prior crimes, future recidivism, age, and gender, black defendants were 45 percent more likely to be assigned higher risk scores than white defendants.

Black defendants were also twice as likely as white defendants to be misclassified as being a higher risk of violent recidivism. And white violent recidivists were 63 percent more likely to have been misclassified as a low risk of violent recidivism, compared with black violent recidivists.
The violent recidivism analysis also showed that even when controlling for prior crimes, future recidivism, age, and gender, black defendants were 77 percent more likely to be assigned higher risk scores than white defendants.

Zeta index files occur when one of the fields in the dataset is grouped.

It consists solely of the grouped field value , the byte number of the start of value , the byte number of the end of the value. Each row generated within the index is expected to be of equal length.

If stored the grouped field can be dropped entirely from the dataset and recalculated by referring to the ζ file. It is named as such because of the z pattern formed by the ordering of start and end values

If the field is ordered as well as grouped the end of value field can be excluded from the ζ index. However it is best to retain it incase only a part of the ζ index survives the ravages of time.

## Expected Submission

A notebook that accomplishes the steps below and makes the ζ index available for download. 

1. Generate the ζ index for the file using publish_date and shuffle the index.
2. Remove the publish_date field from the source file.

Immunization rates in children were decreasing over time in California from 2000-2014.  Changes to state law requiring incoming kindergarten students to have proof of vaccination or medical exemption (as opposed to more easily obtained personal belief exemption) slowed this trend, but vaccination rates in 2015 were still lower than rates in 2000.  See [this kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/broach/evaluating-immunization-rates-2015-update#Revisiting-Kindergarten-Immunization-Rates-in-CA) for more details.  The purpose of this task is to predict how many years it will take for immunization rates in the majority of counties in the state of CA to return to or exceed levels from the year 2000.

For example, in [this kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/broach/replicating-did-i-do-that-paper-analyses-with-r), we took the average value 80-100ms after tone onset to quantify the N100. You can see this in the group average waveforms here:

In this study, we observe that the N100 amplitude is reduced or suppressed when subjects are pressing a button to generate the sound (button-tone, condition=1)
compared to when they are passively listening to the playback of tones (playback, condition = 2).  The task is to build a single trial classification algorithm that can correctly differentiate between self-generated (condition 1) and playback (condition 2) trials

## Expected Submission
Users should submit a csv file with 4 columns, 3 from the original data files, and one column containing the prediction or probability of being a playback trial: subject, trialNumber, Condition, probability

## Evaluation
Area under the curve (AUC) is the best metric to evaluate your predictions.","","Classify EEG trials","binary classification task","","2"

Measurement of the N100 is most often done on the averaged ERP, and that average is calculated across many trials.  However, understanding single trial dynamics of ERP components is of interest in various fields.  The EEG signal is noisy on any given trial, and only a limited number of trials (max 100) are available per subject per condition in this study.  Thus, developing a machine learning algorithm to accurately predict single trial N100 is not an easy task.

## Expected Submission
The ideal submission file would be a csv with subject, trial, condition, and predicted N100 at electrode FCz as its four columns for all trials in the data set ""../input/ERPdata.csv"" from conditions 1 (button-tone) and 2 (playback) only as the third condition (control button press) had no N100.  See [this example kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/broach/predicting-single-trial-n100-starter) to get started

## Evaluation
The evaluation metric for this task is Root Mean Squared Error.  To make the problem even more difficult, one could consider training models exclusively on early trials (e.g., trials 1 through 70) and evaluating prediction exclusively on later trials (e.g., trials 71-100) so that your model is forced to predict N100 from future events.","","Predicting Single Trial N100","Event-related potential (ERP) amplitude regression problem","","1"

3) multilabel classification (backgrounds and letters at the same time);
4) recognition inside words.

1. To expand the database in all directions: the number of brands, products, and quantity of photos inside each brand or product type. The more material for research, so the more interesting experiments can be made. I consider it is possible to recognize such indicators as an individual style by machine learning algorithms at the level of 95-99% of human recognition for this indicator.

2. To supplement the base with some indicators related to customer preferences. For example, which products and styles cause the greatest number of likes or dislikes. We can take into account collections of different years to trace the influence of fashion on success at the moment and successful design “for centuries” (the one that will be popular 10 and 20 years later).

## Expected Submission
Users could apply any algorithms to reach 95-99% of human detection for brands (it should be based on many experiments with the same sets of photos and with thousands of human recognitions) or increase the level of algorithm classification in general.

Other expected results are the new datasets combined with this one and increasing the fields of experiments.

## Evaluation
Evaluations of task realizing are very easy in this case: what levels of recognition we could reach and what kind of interesting additional indicators we could collect.","","Expanding","The Main Task for Every Visual Data","","1"

The aim of this task is to identify which class of flower the image belongs to, by getting the maximum accuracy on the Test set.
The test set will be fixed at 20% of the entire dataset. The rest of the dataset can be used for training and validation and the split for those 2 can be done as per the user's discretion.

Participants will be allowed to manipulate the dataset for increasing the quality or quantity of images in the dataset but must make those datasets public and available to all before submission, to maintain a level playing field for all participants; so only submit when you are sure of your submission!


## Expected Submission
The submission for this task must be a notebook with the maximum accuracy you can achieve on the test set, the outputs must be visible in the notebook. The picking of images for each set must be done at random, and the random seed to be used to make sure that all participants get similar images in every set will be **43**. Submissions not using this value as the seed will not be counted.

## Evaluation
The solution notebooks will run and reviewed by the evaluators individually before assigning you a final score, on the notebook.

I created [a kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/nityeshaga/how-indian-developers-differ) in which I compared Indian developers with the ones from the rest of the world across a wide range of attributes. In this analysis, [I found](https://www.kaggle.com/nityeshaga/how-indian-developers-differ#AI-opinions:) that Indian developers have a considerable different aptitude with regards to various aspects of AI like - 

* Automation of jobs
* Algorithms making important decisions
* AI surpassing human intelligence (""singularity"")
* Fairness in algorithmic versus human decisions

It would be interesting to see similar analysis done on groups created in different ways.

Apply the codes and save them in a seperate .py or .ipynb file DO NOT PUT THE CODE IN YOUR REPORT DOCUMENT, only present your output metrics as well as requested graphs and personal comments in the reprot.

what to do :
1. Linear Discriminant Analysis: 
# apply Linear Discriminant Analysis Feature Reduction with 10 most important components on the properly prepared and standard scaled features from the Voice classification data set with 30% test size for the split percentage, use the obtained reduced features to train,fit and predict on both Logistic Regression and Desicion Tree classifiers , report the accuracy percentages and use the traiend models to obtain the confusion matrices and the classification report on the test part of the data set, plot the confusion matrices as a graphs.

Tip: the labels are in text form convert them into binary numeric form in order to properly work on classifiers.

Tip: use the plot_confusion_matrix method from sklearn.metrics as it is the cleanest approach to output the confusion matrix . 

	
2. Support Vector Machine Classification:
# apply Support Vector Machine Classifiers with Linear Kernel,3rd degree Polynomial Kernel,RBF""Gaussian"" kernel on the feature reduced data obtained from the previous section, report the accuracy percentage and use the traiend models to obtain the confusion matrices and the classification report on the test part of the data set, plot the confusion matrices as a graphs.","","voioce.csv","","06/01/2020 00:00:00","0"

## Evaluation

Clustering quality

Once clustering is done, how well the clustering has performed can be quantified by a number of metrics. Ideal clustering is characterised by minimal intra cluster distance and maximal inter cluster distance.
There are majorly two types of measures to assess the clustering performance.

(i) Extrinsic Measures which require ground truth labels. Examples are Adjusted Rand index, Fowlkes-Mallows scores, Mutual information based scores, Homogeneity, Completeness and V-measure.

(ii) Intrinsic Measures that does not require ground truth labels. Some of the clustering performance measures are Silhouette Coefficient, Calinski-Harabasz Index, Davies-Bouldin Index etc.

Trivially your evaluation is based on  Intrinsic Measures and i suggest start with :  
- Elbow method
- Silhouette analysis

There are advanced statistical methods like Gap statistic which we will explain in kernels.

For example, he has just passed Michael Jordan (Dec 9, 2019) for most consecutive games with 20 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists since the NBA/ABA Merger.

The combination of team victories and stellar individual performances have propelled Luka Doncic to the top of the MVP ladder of some analysts. Incredible!

The main purpose of the data set's recording is to be able to model the stator and rotor temperatures of a PMSM in real-time. Due to the intricate structure of an electric traction drive, direct measurement with thermal sensors is not possible for rotor temperatures, and even in case of the stator temperatures, sensor outage or even just deterioration can't be administered properly without redundant modeling. In addition, precise thermal modeling gets more and more important with the rising relevance of functional safety.
 
Your task is to design a model with appropriate feature engineering, that estimates four target temperatures in a causal manner (no future values should be considered for actual predictions). In order to maintain real-time capability, model sizes should be as small as possible. Note that temperature estimation in production will be deployed on best-cost hardware of traction drives in an automotive environment, where lean computation and lightweight implementation is key.

## Details
### Target features: 
- stator_yoke
- stator_winding
- stator_tooth
- pm

### Input features:
- The remaining features exclusive torque.

Torque is a quantity, which is not reliably measurable in field applications, such that this feature shall be omitted in this task.

### Cross-validation
Profile no. 65 and 72 denote the test set, the rest is for training.

## Expected Submission
Submit a notebook, where the complete pipeline from pre-processing, feature-engineering, model training, and prediction on profiles 65 and 72 is conducted.

## Evaluation
A good solution does
- causal predictions (contemplate only past and current values)
- have a small model size (in terms of amount of parameters and lightweight execution)
- predict stator_* and pm features with a very small **MSE** and a small maximum absolute deviation

## Extra
An additional requirement could be to predict higher temperatures more accurate than low temperatures and have over-estimates more common than under-estimates in order to ensure avoidance of over-heating. These are secondary though due to the more difficult comparability.","","Estimate Important Component Temperatures","Avoid overheating at any time","","21"

In this task you should investigate the different mobile game developers. The task is to identify which developers make the most well received games but for minimal cost. The analyse should highlight developers who publish games with a high cost and include in-app purchases and compare these to developers offering free game downloads. Ideally the solution will identify both developers who charge little for their games and develop excellent games to those who charge a lot an offer poor quality games. Care should be given to statistical relevance (I.e., no solid conclusions can be drawn about a developer with one game with one user review).

Governments are spending a lot of money on military, the idea behind it is to make citizens feel save. The question is, is this really the case? Does spending these large amounts really translate into a feeling of safety and actual safety.

## Expected Submission
Notebooks. This task is mainly about finding other related datasets which explain how safe people in a certain country feel (bonus: and how save they really are). Use whatever statistics you can find and join them with the data in this dataset to figure if the countries spending them most really make their citizens (feel save). Looking mostly for visual explanations here, so charts, tables, heatmaps or whatever you can use to visualize the relationship.

## Evaluation
This is highly subjective, but I'd say explainability counts over accuracy here, e.g. the solution should be easy to comprehend and to get a quick idea, rather than to be perfectly optimized for an optimal fit.","","Does military spend pay off?","Find proof in any data","","5"

In this case, it is a text visualization task.

The dataset contains speeches, interviews, etc. posted online since 1997 (and updated quarterly- the next update is due in June 2021).

The task is simple but can be deliver more: use the information with the ""frequencies"" side of the dataset to show the evolution across time.

Do not add further complexity (e.g. selections, etc), but just show the evolution as a result or dictionary (your choice).

Further tasks will expand on this.

2. find other data-oriented datasets that could show evolution; as the ECB is a European Union institution but anyway within a global context, and my focus now is integrating non-economic/financial factors within corporate reporting, I would like to use at least two other datasets I already posted:
2. a) [UN SDG EU 27 - 7 KPIs on how EU is faring on the 2030 sustainability targets](https://www.kaggle.com/robertolofaro/sdgeu-datamart-sample)
2. b) [Selected indicators from World Bank](https://www.kaggle.com/robertolofaro/selected-indicators-from-world-bank-20002019)

## Expected Submission

I plan to release some material by June 2021, and then identify if I should create other datasets, or implement the current dataset (as an example, I store locally also the press releases, but are not shown on the online database)

Currently my weekly update is done manually (each Sunday), due to the varying format of the source material (sometimes text, sometimes, PDF presentations, sometimes lists)- but I would like to explore scraping option to automate the process

Anyway- if you post Notebooks suggesting other areas of development, I will see to include / amend further requirements, KPIs, etc

## Evaluation

I am interested (and working on) what can be repeatable, not linked to a single, specific event (albeit once in a while I use the database also to support my publications focused on specific events or ideas)

Credit score cards are a common risk control method in the financial industry. It uses personal information and data submitted by credit card applicants to predict the probability of future defaults and credit card borrowings. The bank is able to decide whether to issue a credit card to the applicant. Credit scores can objectively quantify the magnitude of risk.
&nbsp;
Generally speaking, credit score cards are based on historical data. Once encountering large economic fluctuations. Past models may lose their original predictive power. Logistic model is a common method for credit scoring. Because Logistic is suitable for binary classification tasks and can calculate the coefficients of each feature. In order to facilitate understanding and operation, the score card will multiply the logistic regression coefficient by a certain value (such as 100) and round it.
&nbsp;
At present, with the development of machine learning algorithms. More predictive methods such as Boosting, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines have been introduced into credit card scoring. However, these methods often do not have good transparency. It may be difficult to provide customers and regulators with a reason for rejection or acceptance.


## Expected Submission
Your high-quality notebooks.

## Evaluation

Build a machine learning model to predict if an applicant is 'good' or 'bad' client, different from other tasks, the definition of 'good' or 'bad' is not given. You should use some techique, such as [vintage analysis](https://www.listendata.com/2019/09/credit-risk-vintage-analysis.html) to construct you label. Also, unbalance data problem is a big problem in this task.

As part of my https://robertolofaro.com/datademocracy, in January 2020 released a sample dashboard on EU Member States status vs. UN SDG.

Specifically, I had selected few that are related to the themes I am writing on (digital transformation, innovation, cultural and organizational change).

But, actually, had used the material for few articles since late November 2019, e.g.

* [2019-11-26 just few doubts on #national and #local challenges in #Italy and #Turin - how well we are coping with them - #industry #development #SDG #smartcity](http://robertolofaro.com/index.php?page=381)
* [2019-12-30 Assessing systemically: the data side of #European #Union #integration within #digital #transformation](http://robertolofaro.com/index.php?page=391)

The dataset is small- purposedfully: if you need details, you can visit the source website (see the [documentation of this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/robertolofaro/sdgeu-datamart-sample)).

The aim is to 
1. identify correlations between KPIs (e.g. look at the discussion about the KPI IT_USE_ii99 within the 2019-12-30 article listed above)
2. find supporting datasets that are not within those that I already posted online
3. identify further tasks (or subtasks)
4. considering that the KPIs should be updated yearly until 2030, define and implement a pipeline that automates as much as possible activities (e.g. from scraping to cleaning/transformation to aggregation and presentation).

## Expected Submission

I plan to release some material by June 2021, and then identify if I should create other datasets, or implement the current dataset (as an example, I store locally also the press releases, but are not shown on the online database)

Anyway- if you post Notebooks suggesting other areas of development, I will see to include / amend further requirements, KPIs, etc

## Evaluation

I am interested (and working on) what can be repeatable, not linked to a single, specific event (albeit once in a while I use the database also to support my publications focused on specific events or ideas)

## Expected Submission
You should submit a notebook that illustrates your approach to predicting output sequences and generates a validation score.

## Evaluation
The primary outputs of interest are from the first process stage (see notes on dataset). Outputs consist of 15 dimensional measurements taken each second. There are 3 evaluation criteria for models:

**1. Accuracy.**   Defined by RMSE of predicted vs observed outputs over the prediction horizon.
**2. Prediction horizon.**   How far ahead can you predict with reasonable accuracy? 30 time steps? 60? 120?
**3. Number of outputs.**   Some of the 15 output measurements are easier to predict than others. How many can you predict?

Bonus points if you can predict the 15 output measurements from the second stage... it's much more challenging!

This dataset is created for Phase 3 of the 3rd Deep Learning and AI Summer/Winter School (DLAI3). More details about the challenge can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/dlai3/.

Medical image analysis has continually been an area of prominent and growing importance, in both the research and application aspects. However, it is important to realize that the algorithms, methodology, as well as the source of data, need to be strictly scrutinized. Phase 3 of the DLAI3 Hackathon is a challenge that provides a mixed dataset of publicly available COVID-19 chest x-ray images from various sources, a pneumonia dataset obtained from a study on children, partially verified thorax CXR images of adults from NIH, and unverified no-finding images from NIH. See below for the sources of these data.

The participants are challenged to obtain good performance in their modeling in the Public and Private Leaderboards, as well as to be able to interpret their results in form of a full paper submission to CSBio2020 under CHAT-2020 (www.csbio.org/2020/).

Please cite this dataset as follows: Jonathan H. Chan, “DLAI3 Hackathon Phase3 COVID-19 CXR Challenge.” Kaggle, doi: 10.34740/KAGGLE/DSV/1347344.

## Expected Submission

Overview
Almost 10,000 billion freight tonne-kilometres are travelled around the world. Roughly one quarter of these are travelled in the United States, another quarter in China, and a third in Russia. Of the 3,000bn passenger-kilometres travelled across the world, 1,346bn of these are travelled solely in China. The average Swiss person travels 2,430 km by train each year, almost 500 more than the average Japanese person (the Japanese having the second-highest average kilometres travelled per passenger in the world).

In 2014, there were around 1 million kilometres of railway in the world (a decrease of 3% compared to 2013). Of this, 350,000 km were in Europe and mainly used for passenger service, 370,000 km were in North America and mainly used for freight, and 230,000 km were in Asia and used for both freight and passenger service.In America and Europe, there are many low cost airlines and motorways which compete with rail for passenger traffic, while Asia has seen a large growth in high-speed rail with 257bn pkm representing 72% of total world high-speed rail passenger traffic.","","Forecast Rail Usage by Country until 2050","Forecast Rail Usage by Country until 2050","12/31/2021 23:59:00","0"

In all cases, they refer to bonds whose capital repayment is guaranteed by governments. Long-term interest rates are one of the determinants of business investment.

Today’s visual data collection, annotation, and analysis practices are still costly, prone to error, and cumbersome as performed manually. While online street-level imagery databases contain updated panoramic images of all signs, their potential for understanding on-street parking restrictions at scale has not been fully explored. The key benefit of these databases is that once the parking signs are detected, accurate geographic coordinates of the detected signs can be automatically determined and visualized within the same platform. This paper evaluates the application of a computer vision-based method for parking signs recognition from street-level imagery aimed at facilitating the parking in dense cities. The method extracts images and leverages a sliding window mechanism to detect potential candidates for parking signs. A Histogram of Oriented Gradients for each candidate is formed and trained. Hard negative mining approach is then used at final stage to remove the remaining false positives. The potential detections of images from multiple viewpoints are then combined to locate the position of the signs on a map. Experimental results with high accuracy demonstrate the potential of leveraging street-level images and provide a viable solution for digitizing at scale all parking signs to help drivers understand parking rules and avoid fines.","","Automated Recognition and Localization of Parking Signs Using Street-Level Imagery","Automated Recognition and Localization of Parking Signs Using Street-Level Imagery","12/31/2020 23:59:00","0"

Introduction
In his explorations of personality, British psychologist Raymond Cattell found that variations in human personality could be best explained by a model that has sixteen variables (personality traits), using a statisical procedure known as factor analysis. Following this discovery he went on to create and promote the 16PF Questionnaire. This test uses a public domain scales from the Internation Personality Item Pool to measure the same traits.

Procedure
This personality test consists of 164 statements about yourself, for each indicate how accurate it is on the scale of (1) disagree (2) slightly disagree (3) niether agree nor disagree (4) slightly agree (5) agree.

In the field of personality psychology, Machiavellianism is a personality trait centered on manipulativeness, callousness, and indifference to morality.[1] Though unrelated to the historical figure or his works, the trait is named after the political philosophy of Niccolò Machiavelli, as psychologists Richard Christie and Florence Geis used edited and truncated statements inspired by his works to study variations in human behaviors.[2][3][4] Their Mach IV test, a 20-question, Likert-scale personality survey, became the standard self-assessment tool and scale of the Machiavellianism construct. Those who score high on the scale (High Machs) are more likely to have a high level of deceitfulness and a unempathetic temperament.[5]

It is one of the dark triad traits, along with narcissism and psychopathy.

Because the concept of self esteem is one most people should be familar with, this test will proably not tell you anything you do not allready know. You should have a pretty good grasp of your results just by asking yourself the question, ""do I have low self esteem?"" The scale can however give you a better picture of your state in relation to other people. Your results will also include a little bit more about the relationship between self esteem and life outcomes.

Procedure
The scale consists of ten statements that you could possibly apply to you that you must rate on how much you agree with each. The items should be answered quickly without overthinking, your first inclination is what you should put down.

Participation
In addition to being offered for public education purposes, this survey is being used as part of a research project and your answers will be recorded. By starting this test you are agreeing to have any data you enter used for research.","","Analyze 48k Answers to the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale","Analyze 48k Answers to the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale","","0"

This is an online version of the Experiences in Close Relationships Scale, a test of attachment style.

Introduction
Attachment style is how an individual behaves in relationships with other.

The ECR was created in 1998 by Kelly Brennan, Catherine Clark and Phillip Shaver. It groups people into four different categories on the basis of scores along two scales.

Procedure
The inventory consists of thirty six that must be rated on how characteristic they are of the subject. The test should not take most people more than four minutes.

Open Sex-Role Inventory
This is an interactive personality test measuring masculinity and femininity (or gendered personality traits) modeled on the Bem Sex-Role Inventory.

Background
In the 1970s Sandra Bem developed the Bem Sex-Role Inventory to challenge the view the masculinity and femininity were polar opposites and that a masculinity-femininity not matching your gender was a sign of poor mental health. Bem thought that it was possible to be both masculine and feminine at the same time and that this was the healthiest psychological state. The Open Sex Role Inventory was developed as open source, modernized measure of masculinity and femininity. The documentation of its development can be found here.


Test Instructions
The test has 22 statements of opinion that you must rate on a seven point scale of how much you agree with each. It should take most people 4-6 minutes to complete.

Instance-based prediction of real-valued attributes. {it Computational Intelligence}, {it 5}, 51--57. -- Predicted price of car using all numeric and Boolean attributes -- Method: an instance-based learning (IBL) algorithm derived from a localized k-nearest neighbor algorithm. Compared with a linear regression prediction...so all instances with missing attribute values were discarded. This resulted with a training set of 159 instances, which was also used as a test set (minus the actual instance during testing). -- Results: Percent Average Deviation Error of Prediction from Actual -- 11.84% for the IBL algorithm -- 14.12% for the resulting linear regression equation

Relevant Information: -- Description This data set consists of three types of entities: (a) the specification of an auto in terms of various characteristics, (b) its assigned insurance risk rating, (c) its normalized losses in use as compared to other cars. The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates. Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price. Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale. Actuarians call this process ""symboling"". A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe.

The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year. This value is normalized for all autos within a particular size classification (two-door small, station wagons, sports/speciality, etc...), and represents the average loss per car per year.

The trimming of trees under distribution lines on city streets and in rural areas is a major problem and expense for electrical utilities. Such operations are routinely performed at intervals of one to eight years depending upon the individual species growth rate and the amount of clearance required. Ontario Hydro trims about 500,000 trees per year at a cost of about $25 per tree.

Much effort has been spent in developing chemicals for the horticultural industry to retard the growth of woody and herbaceous plants. Recently, a group of new growth regulators was introduced which was shown to be effective in controlling the growth of trees without producing noticeable injury symptoms. In this group are PP 333 ( common name paclobutrazol) (2RS, 3RS - 1 -(4-chlorophenyl) - 4,4 - dimethyl - 2 - (1,2,4-triazol-l-yl) pentan - 3- ol and EL-500 (common name flurprimidol and composition alpha - (1-methylethyl) - alpha - [4-(trifluromethoxyl) phenyl] - 5- pyrimidine - methanol). Both EL-500 and PP-333 have been reported to control excessive sprout growth in a number of species when applied as a foliar spray, as a soil drench, or by trunk injection. Sprout length is a function of both the number of internodes and the length of the individual internodes in the sprout. While there have been many reports that both PP 333 and EL-500 cause a reduction in the length of internodes formed in sprouts on woody plants treated with the growth regulators, there has been but one report that EL-500 application to apple trees resulted in a reduction of the number of internodes formed per sprout","","Find relevant features in Tree Growth","Find relevant features in Tree Growth","12/31/2021 23:59:00","0"

In the context of a COVID-19 pandemic, we want to improve prognostic predictions to triage and manage patient care. Data is the first step to developing any diagnostic/prognostic tool. While there exist large public datasets of more typical chest X-rays from the NIH [Wang 2017], Spain [Bustos 2019], Stanford [Irvin 2019], MIT [Johnson 2019] and Indiana University [Demner-Fushman 2016], there is no collection of COVID-19 chest X-rays or CT scans designed to be used for computational analysis.

The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) presents several unique features Fang, 2020 and Ai 2020. While the diagnosis is confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), infected patients with pneumonia may present on chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images with a pattern that is only moderately characteristic for the human eye Ng, 2020. In late January, a Chinese team published a paper detailing the clinical and paraclinical features of COVID-19. They reported that patients present abnormalities in chest CT images with most having bilateral involvement Huang 2020. Bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation constitute the typical findings in chest CT images of intensive care unit (ICU) patients on admission Huang 2020. In comparison, non-ICU patients show bilateral ground-glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation in their chest CT images Huang 2020. In these patients, later chest CT images display bilateral ground-glass opacity with resolved consolidation Huang 2020.

Goal
Our goal is to use these images to develop AI based approaches to predict and understand the infection. Our group will work to release these models using our open source Chester AI Radiology Assistant platform.

The tasks are as follows using chest X-ray or CT (preference for X-ray) as input to predict these tasks:

Healthy vs Pneumonia (prototype already implemented Chester with ~74% AUC, validation study here)

Bacterial vs Viral vs COVID-19 Pneumonia (not relevant enough for the clinical workflows)

Everyone knows that time-series data from building energy and automation systems are messy. Meters and sensors fail, have huge spikes, and other unreasonable behavior due to various glitches in the system. Buildings can have periods of 'weird' behavior in which the building is being used in a completely different way from 'normal'. Equipment can fail or there can be outages of energy due to events or natural disasters.

Identifying these periods of anomalous behavior is important for numerous reasons:
- Finding anomalies may result in the identification of energy-saving opportunities for a building/buildings
- Removing anomalous behavior from training data may result in improved short and long term ML prediction/regression
- Separating anomalous behavior gives a sense of the behavior of certain operating modes of the building

There are two types of meter data files in this data set -- those with the suffix `_clean.csv` and those without. The ones that are *clean* have already been put through a process of cleaning that is defined in the documentation for each of those files. Those without the suffix are considered the *raw* data and you can try to apply your own cleaning techniques to see how to find weird/anomalous behavior.

There are numerous outlier detection methods out there! Some of the examples of Python packages for this task are:
- https://pyod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- https://pypi.org/project/anomatools/
- https://github.com/linkedin/luminol
- https://github.com/TDAmeritrade/stumpy

## Expected Submission
Users should submit a single notebook that describes the setup, processing, and results of their analysis of the BDG2 project that illustrates a solution for outlier removal and/or anomaly detection. Users should give details on the advantages and disadvantages of the approach. The single notebook should have references to other publicly shared notebooks from the person/team who submitted that may provide intermediate analysis steps that aren't contained in the submitted notebook.

The analysis should include a lot of documentation to provide clarity of the techniques and approaches used. The submission can use code and ideas from other Kaggle notebooks/submissions as long as credit is given in the form of links and written documentation, but it must be clear what innovation has been added to previous efforts from others.

This repository contains time-series data files that have not been cleaned that can be used for this task - i.e: the files **without** the `_clean.csv` suffix. Comparison of the proposed anomaly detection approach with the cleaned files might be a good way to measure differences.

OK, so we have an open data set of building meter data. It's not big, but not small. We can apply all kinds of data science techniques and stuff -- but *why?* Why would anyone who runs a company that wants to make money care about the use of these data?

This task prompts you to create an example Kaggle notebook that outlines a potential use case of the BDG2 data set that would be helpful to a profit-driven company. This use case could be within the building industry, but that isn't required. 

Ideally, this use case would include the following sections:
1. A introduction and discussion of the situation in this business that has a **problem** in need of a solution that can be solved through the use of meter data. 
2. A proposal of a use of the hourly meter data, like those in this dataset that could be used to provide a **solution** to that problem. This solution can be very practical and implementable on real buildings immediately tomorrow, or it could be more theoretical and could depend on the market transforming in certain ways to make it possible in the medium or long term. You can imagine scenarios that use other data sources beyond the BDG2 dataset - and you're welcome to even use those datasets in your solution.
3. A set of data visualizations that give a simple example of the problem and solution using data from the BDG2 data set. This is what we call a *toy example* as your goal is to show step-by-step how your idea works on real data. This example could even be done on a single meter. You are welcome to use any type of analysis method -- all the way from human-driven data visual analytics to advanced machine learning/prediction/regression/classification. 
4. A conclusion and discussion on how your solution could scale across the building stock -- this is a massive challenge for some techniques and easier for others. If reasonable, you can try to show your technique/idea across many or all buildings/meters in the BDG2 dataset as an example of scalability.

Some generic ideas that could provide a starting point:
- Companies need to make decisions about renovations of their buildings. Sometimes they need to decide what kind of renovations would be best or which buildings are the best candidates for renovation. Using prediction can assist in the *measurement and verification* process for determining energy savings due to implemented measures.
- Companies often want to identify the behavior of the way occupants use buildings or the way operators manage buildings. They want to understand how the building is being used so that they can implement technologies or interventions that improve the energy performance, or health/safety of the occupants. Sometimes the behavior of buildings by occupants is related to things like airborne disease control - ie: the density of occupants in the spaces.
- Companies sometimes want to identify the best targets for their products. They want to fine-tune their marketing and advertising to maximize their customer acquisition or retention. Understanding how a building uses energy might be an emerging means of informing those decisions.
- Companies who work in the smart grid area might want to use meter data to get a sense of how renewable energy sources such as solar and wind can be better integrated into the grid. They might want to provide consulting to utilities to help them avoid the need to build expensive electricity generation plants that would only be needed during high peak periods.

## Expected Submission
Each submission will be a Kaggle notebook submitted to this task. It should be documented very well using the text cells in addition to the code that processes the data.

## Evaluation
The solutions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Content:
- The content should be compelling to someone who is interested in the answers to the objectives
- Convince your audience that your scope is appropriate and interesting and the decisions your team made were good ones
- Your team is providing evidence to back up the decisions made
- There are no ‘key word’ or specific things I’m looking for in marking or evaluating your project – it's all about the evidence you give to show that your structure, logic, and results are done compelling or not

Clarity:
- Simple, step-by-step explanation of the sections
- Good use of diagrams, graphics, and data visualization
- You can download, modify and reupload graphics with arrows and annotations to explain concepts even further than what you can do using just Python/pandas

We all have a sense of how buildings use energy because we live and work in buildings. We know that when it gets hotter outside, there is often a cooling system that ramps up to keep us comfortable. We know that when the sun goes down, we need lights to allow us to see properly. Some buildings are highly influenced by the humans inside them who turn on devices such as TV's or computers during certain time-frames. In commercial buildings, there are big systems that might be on a certain schedule in which they turn on in the morning and turn off at night.

The goal of this task is to prototype ways to extract signals from the data that indicate which factors are the main sources of driving energy demand in each of the buildings. There are numerous examples of detecting and extracting weather influence in the literature, but other influences might be more challenging. 

Since the data set has little ground truth (such as submeters that specifically measure a type of energy), this task includes a certain amount of exploratory analysis and key assumptions made by the data scientists who work on it. Supervised and unsupervised ML techniques might be important tools to help dissect this problem, but they are not required in the solution.

## Expected Submission
Users should submit a single notebook that describes the setup, processing, and results of their method of detecting and visualizing the factors that influence energy consumption. The single notebook should have references to other publicly shared notebooks from the person/team who submitted that may provide intermediate analysis steps that aren't contained in the submitted notebook.

The analysis should include a lot of documentation to provide clarity of the techniques and approaches used. The submission can use code and ideas from other Kaggle notebooks/submissions as long as credit is given in the form of links and written documentation, but it must be clear what innovation has been added to previous efforts from others.

## Relevant Literature
Section 2 of [this open-access paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-4990/1/3/56/htm) gives a high level understanding of what factors influence building energy consumption as well as references that can be further explored.

## Evaluation

Researchers who explore subjective thermal perception in buildings can ask occupants basically the same question in several different ways: they can ask whether the person feels comfortable, whether they perceive a cooling or heating sensation, or whether they would prefer for the systems in the building to produce more heating or cooling. A comparison of the differences between these ways of asking the question of whether you are ""hot"" or ""cold"" deserves an analysis.

There is a lot of recent discussion on whether thermal comfort is really taking into consideration the needs of all occupants. There have even been popular news outlets who have covered stories on sexism in office temperatures from the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/28/nyregion/office-temperature-sexist-nixon-cuomo.html), [the New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/is-your-thermostat-sexist), and [Time Magazine](https://time.com/5592353/office-temperature-study/). The question related to this task is to piece together evidence from the ASHRAE Thermal Comfort Database II to show how factors such as sex, age, metabolism, and other factors influence comfort. 

This task can likely be done with exploratory analysis to characterize the differences as well as metrics or transformations of the data (from literature or created by the team) to detect an influence of factors. Supervised and unsupervised ML techniques might be important tools to help dissect this problem, but they are not required in the submission.

## Expected Submission

The concept of [acclimatization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acclimatization) might be linked to how people feel in the built environment thermally. For example, if someone grows up in a hot, humid climate (like Singapore), then they might be more sensitive to colder temperatures causing them to report discomfort differently than people from cold climates. Or maybe they like cold temperatures more since it provides relief from their climate. 

The goal of this task is to analyze the data set to determine whether where the person is located has an influence on their tendency to have comfort preferences that are different than other locations.

This task can likely be done with exploratory analysis to characterize the differences as well as metrics or transformations of the data (from literature or created by the team) to detect an influence of factors.

Looking at China's growth rate over time, we can clearly see that they were able to curb the growth rate of the virus. Over the last few weeks, different countries have performed different forms of mitigation to do the same: ban large gatherings, close schools, stop incoming flights, put cities in lockdown, etc.

The task is to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation by trying to see if a correlation can discovered between the different types of mitigation and the growth rate of confirmed cases. What measures seem to work and which not? Which ones are the most effective?

Keep in mind there are numerous factors which might affect the grow rate (e.g. country's general hygiene, population density, how much time they had to prepare) so not all countries can be compared easily.

The outbreak of Covid-19 is developing into a major international crisis, and it's starting to influence important aspects of daily life. For example:
- Travel: Bans have been placed on hotspot countries, corporate travel has been reduced, and flight fares have dropped.
- Supply chains: International manufacturing operations have often had to throttle back production and many goods solely produced in China have been halted altogether. 
- Grocery stores: In highly affected areas, people are starting to stock up on essential goods.

A strong model that predicts how the virus could spread across different countries and regions may be able to help mitigation efforts. The goal of this task is to build a model that predicts the progression of the virus throughout March 2020.

## Expected Submission
Submit a notebook that implements the full lifecycle of data preparation, model creation and evaluation. Feel free to use this dataset plus any other data you have available. Since this is not a formal competition, you're not submitting a single submission file, but rather your whole approach to building a model. 

With this model, you should produce a table in the following format for all future days of March (similar to `covid_19_data.csv`)
- `ObservationDate`: Observation date in mm/dd/yyyy
- `Province/State`: Province or State
- `Country/Region`: Country or region
- `Confirmed`: Cumulative number of confirmed cases
- `Deaths`: Cumulative number of deaths cases
- `Recovered`: Cumulative number of recovered cases


The notebook should be well documented and contain:

1. Any steps you're taking to prepare the data, including references to external data sources
2. Training of your model
3. The table mentioned above
4. An evaluation of your table against the real data. Let's keep it simple and measure Mean Absolute Error.

## Evaluation
This is not a formal competition, so we won't measure the results strictly against a given validation set using a strict metric. Rather, what we'd like to see is a well-defined process to build a model that can deliver decent results (evaluated by yourself).

At the end of March, we'll look at the top 5 upvoted submissions and holistically award the best solution. We’ll announce and recognize March’s Kaggle Tasks Award Winner on our Twitter account at the beginning of April, sharing an official certificate of accomplishment.

Our team will be looking at:

1. **Accuracy** - How well does the model perform on the real data? Can it be generalized over time? Can it be applied to other scenarios? Was it overfit?
2. **Data Preparation** - How well was the data analyzed prior to feeding it into the model? Are there any useful visualizations? Does the reader learn any new techniques through this submission? A great entry will be informative, thought provoking, and fresh all at the same time.
3. **Documentation** - Are your code, and notebook, and additional data sources well documented so a reader can understand what you did? Are your sources clearly cited? A high quality analysis should be concise and clear at each step so the rationale is easy to follow and the process is reproducible.

This task is not strictly about getting the best submission score. Since it involves data that changes in real-time, the most accurate solution would only require uploading the real historic data on the last day of March, but that’s besides the spirit of this Task. We’re looking for genuine approaches to building models on a real problem that can serve as learning examples for our community","","Predict the Spreading of Coronavirus","Can we help mitigate the secondary effects of covid-19 by predicting its spread","03/31/2020 00:00:00","225"

It is necessary to flatten the curve so much so that healthcare infrastructure in the country can manage the peak number of patients at any given time.

The dataset contains the details of number of beds and hospitals (statewise distribution can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/dheerajmpai/hospitals-and-beds-in-india)). The database also contains individual patient data. (for real time data access [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSc_2y5N0I67wDU38DjDh35IZSIS30rQf7_NYZhtYYGU1jJYT6_kDx4YpF-qw0LSlGsBYP8pqM_a1Pd/pubhtml)).

""Test, test, test"" was what WHO said to prevent spread of Covid-19. 

Covid-19 takes some time to show symptoms. In some cases there are [no symptoms](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/03/people-with-mild-or-no-symptoms-could-be-spreading-covid-19/) at all. Early testing and isolating the coronavirus patients can prevent spread of disease.

Not all countries have the same testing capacities. India as of now has tested upto 25,000 suspect. Even developed nations like US had the capacity to test only 7000[ suspects per day](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/18/817768723/u-s-coronavirus-testing-starts-to-ramp-up-but-still-lags) (until 14th March). 

## Using algorithms to speed up testing

Pooling is a simple algorithm that can speed up testing ([here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tTfnultRwlYExroAbT4n-4pwN0Hr_liH/view?usp=sharing), [here](https://www.israel21c.org/israelis-introduce-method-for-accelerated-covid-19-testing/)). In layman’s term samples of a group of individuals are mixed together and tested at once. If the test turns out negative we know none of the individual is infected. If it turns out to be positive then we divide the original group into two and repeat the procedure.

There can be multiple ways to do that. It can also be done in two steps. Test a group. If found positive then test each individual samples. It can be done in three steps. In fact, we can come up with a affective coding algorithm to shuffle up multiple individual samples and find the cases in one go. Or any other creative way.

In a region with low probability of infection these techniques can drastically reduce the number of required testing. 

Aspects that needs to be taken under consideration while analysing
1. Please keep the real life situation in mind. Explicitly mention the assumptions. For example, testing takes time. A suspect cannot wait for 100 test Sequential testing only delays the result. Also, avoid cases where you test 1 billion at one shot.
2. Keep your algorithm as simple as possible. It should be explained easily to a paramedic.
3. Compare your results with the existing solutions and other proposed solutions. Explain the advantages. (In terms of time taken or the number of tests for the population)

**Compress the 1GB file enwik9 to less than the current record of about 116MB**

Being able to compress well is closely related to intelligence as explained below. While intelligence is a slippery concept, file sizes are hard numbers. Wikipedia is an extensive snapshot of Human Knowledge. If you can compress the first 1GB of Wikipedia better than your predecessors, your (de)compressor likely has to be smart(er). The intention of this prize is to encourage development of intelligent compressors/programs as a path to AGI.
Interview with Lex Fridman (26.Feb'20) ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AxVXt2Gv4), [Audio](https://lexfridman.com/marcus-hutter), [Tweet](https://twitter.com/lexfridman/status/1232726312206393344))

## The Task

Losslessly compress the 1GB file enwik9 to less than 116MB. More precisely:

- Create a Linux or Windows compressor comp.exe of size S1 that compresses enwik9 to archive.exe of size S2 such that S:=S1+S2 &lt; L := 116'673'681 = [previous record](http://prize.hutter1.net/#prev).
- If run, archive.exe produces (without input from other sources) a 10^9 byte file that is identical to enwik9.
- If we can verify your claim, you are eligible for a prize of [500'000€×(1-S/L)](http://prize.hutter1.net/hfaq.htm#money). Minimum claim is 5'000€ (1% improvement).
- Restrictions: Must run in ≲100 hours using a single CPU core and &lt;10GB RAM and &lt;100GB HDD on our [test machine](http://browser.primatelabs.com/v4/cpu/145066).

Remark: You can download the zipped version [enwik9.zip](http://mattmahoney.net/dc/enwik9.zip) of enwik9 here (≈300MB). Please find more details including constraints and relaxations at http://prize.hutter1.net/hrules.htm.

## Motivation

This compression contest is motivated by the fact that being able to compress well is closely related to acting intelligently, thus reducing the slippery concept of intelligence to hard file size numbers. In order to compress data, one has to find regularities in them, which is intrinsically difficult (many researchers live from analyzing data and finding compact models). So compressors beating the current ""dumb"" compressors need to be smart(er). Since the prize wants to stimulate developing ""universally"" smart compressors, we need a ""universal"" corpus of data. Arguably the online encyclopedia Wikipedia is a good snapshot of the Human World Knowledge. So the ultimate compressor of it should ""understand"" all human knowledge, i.e. be really smart. enwik9 is a hopefully representative 1GB extract from Wikipedia.","","Hutter Prize for Compressing Human Knowledge - 500'000€","Compress the 1GB file enwik9 to less than the current record of about 116MB","","0"

Finding relevant insights on this important issue is no easy task. This dataset brings together data of several different types to enable more complete analysis. Kaggle has announced an upcoming effort to create several challenges including analytic challenges. This is a good chance to get a head start.
https://www.kaggle.com/general/165766

## The Task
Use several data sources together to answer (or partially answer) a question that people care about. For instance:
 - What can we say about militarizing police? Does it make police safer? Does it lead to more citizen deaths? Does it reduce crime?
- How do police forces compare across important dimensions? What groupings might exist such as ""high budget - high arrests - shoots people"", or ""high budget - low arrests - low violence"". How does that correlate with community safety?

## Expected Submission
The typical submission is a report-style notebook containing your analysis and findings. I describe my idea of what that means in this notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/jpmiller/some-best-practices-for-analytics-reporting

## Evaluation

Each observation in the dataset contains information about whether the heart failure patients had died before the follow-up period indicated by the ""time"" column in the data set. Thus, ""DEATH_EVENT""=0 does *not* mean that the patient did not die, only that the patient had not died by the time of the follow-up.

Survival analysis was developed to estimate the life spans of individuals based on data where the outcome was censored by a follow-up duration. It is a method to answer questions such as ""How likely is a person to die within a certain time period?""

This dataset was first presented by two Pakistani researchers, where the results were analyzed using an appropriate Cox proportional hazards model. See the original research here: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0181001

It has subsequently been analyzed in machine learning context, ignoring the censoring problem. The aim of this task is to get submissions where the survival part is dealt with.

There exists a range of methods to estimate survival models. By far, the most used one in health science is the [Cox proportional hazards model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_model). A notable python package for the purpose is [lifelines](https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/).

In my career I had a project to build a garage detection system, but unfortunately (as with many projects) the project never went forward. I was excited about the project, so I decided to try and replicate the project using images on Google. I thought this would also be a great opportunity to work on semi-supervised learning techniques and collaborate with the data science community on the topic!

**In this task, only a small faction of the images are labeled for training and holdout, and there are many more unlabeled images, hence the need for semi-supervised learning!  Use semi-supervised learning or supervised learning to train a classifier that performs best on holdout!**

Kaggle has a lot of competitions, but not many that really REQUIRE semi-supervised learning. This dataset and ""unofficial challenge"" is in spirit of semi-supervised learning education and experimentation.

## Expected Submission
Please use the following file to score your final model:

`image_labels_holdout.csv`

Performance will be based on AUC. Please use the following code to compute your holdout AUC score.

```
fpr, tpr, thresholds = metrics.roc_curve(y, pred, pos_label=1)
metrics.auc(fpr, tpr)
# 0.75
```
In order to have an unofficial learderboard, I ask that you use the following format to title your notebooks and scripts.

`[GDUC - 0.0000] Whatever You Want`

For example ""[GDUC - 0.9417] Self-training Baseline"". This will allow people to sort by notebook name and see the highest scoring notebooks for this ""unofficial challenge""!

## Evaluation

Performance will be based on AUC. Please use the following code to compute your holdout AUC score.

```
fpr, tpr, thresholds = metrics.roc_curve(y, pred, pos_label=1)
metrics.auc(fpr, tpr)
# 0.75
```

A classic task in document management is document classification. In other words, given a document can we assign it to a general topic? What if a paper can have multiple topics associated with it? It would be useful when for example building a recommender system of categories for a paper based on its content.

As such, this can be framed as a [multi label classification problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-label_classification). Given an abstract what topics/tags can we confidently assign to it without human intervention.

### Set up
For those who would like to compare model results, you can follow below instructions to prepare the test_set. Or just download it [from here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j5bxdmdeyow45f3/validation.json?dl=0).

To be able to compare scores we will make following assumptions:
- We will be using the abstracts for validation data published on or after **2019-01-01**. 
- We will use the **same seeds** for train and test split and sampling.
- We will only focus on predicting the **general category**, ex.g. math instead of math.CS.

Use code below to sample and split into train and test. You can refer to [this notebook for examples](https://www.kaggle.com/kobakhit/eda-and-multi-label-classification-for-arxiv#Competition:-Prepare-data-for-multi-label-classification).
```python
import dask.bag as db
import json

SEED = 4 # bounces

docs = db.read_text('../input/arxiv/arxiv-metadata-oai-snapshot-2020-08-14.json').map(json.loads)

# get only necessary fields
trim = lambda x: {'id': x['id'],
                  'title': x['title'],
                  'category':x['categories'].split(' '),
                  'abstract':x['abstract']}
# filter for papers published on or after 2019-01-01
columns = ['id','category','abstract']
docs_df = (docs
             .filter(lambda x: int(get_latest_version(x).split(' ')[3]) &gt; 2018)
             .map(trim)
             .compute())

# convert to pandas
docs_df = pd.DataFrame(docs_df)

# add general category. we are going to use as our target variable
docs_df['general_category'] = docs_df.category.apply(lambda x:[a.split('.')[0] for a in x])

# shuffle or sample and keep columns that have at least 1 positive example
sample_df = df.sample(frac = 1, random_state = SEED)
keep = sample_df.iloc[:,2:].apply(sum) &gt; 1
sample_df = pd.concat([sample_df.iloc[:,:2],sample_df.iloc[:,2:].iloc[:,keep.values]], axis = 1)

categories = sample_df.columns[2:]

# removed categories
print('Removed following categories from training : {}'.format(str(keep[~keep].index.to_list())))

# split into train and test
train, test = train_test_split(sample_df, random_state=SEED, test_size=0.15, shuffle=True)

X_train = train.abstract
X_test = test.abstract

print(X_train.shape)
print(X_test.shape)
```

## Expected Submission
A list of documents and assigned topics. It can be framed as a **multi-label classification problem** and the submission will look like this:

| documnet id | topics |
| --- | --- |
| 01 | ['computer science','math'] |
| 02 | ['physics'] |
| ... | ... |




## Evaluation
Use [this test set](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j5bxdmdeyow45f3/validation.json?dl=0) or code from previous section. The two metrics I would recommend are 
- Hamming [Score](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/233275/multilabel-classification-metrics-on-scikit)/[Loss](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.hamming_loss.html)
- Exact Match Ratio (`accuracy_score` in `sklearn.metrics`)

Currently the benchmark is ([from here](https://www.kaggle.com/kobakhit/eda-and-multi-label-classification-for-arxiv#Competition:-Prepare-data-for-multi-label-classification))

| Metric |  Value|
|--|--|
| Hamming Loss |  0.0263|
| Hamming Score|  0.7718|
| Accuracy |  0.6265|

To get those scores you can use below code
```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, hamming_loss

# to evaluate the multi label classification model use below metrics
print('Hamming loss : {}'.format(hamming_loss(y_true,y_pred)))
print('Accuracy : {}'.format(accuracy_score(y_true,y_pred)))
```

```python
def hamming_score(y_true, y_pred, normalize=True, sample_weight=None):
    '''
    Compute the Hamming score (a.k.a. label-based accuracy) for the multi-label case
    http://stackoverflow.com/q/32239577/395857
    '''
    acc_list = []
    for i in range(y_true.shape[0]):
        set_true = set( np.where(y_true[i])[0] )
        set_pred = set( np.where(y_pred[i])[0] )
        #print('\nset_true: {0}'.format(set_true))
        #print('set_pred: {0}'.format(set_pred))
        tmp_a = None
        if len(set_true) == 0 and len(set_pred) == 0:
            tmp_a = 1
        else:
            tmp_a = len(set_true.intersection(set_pred))/\
                    float( len(set_true.union(set_pred)) )
        #print('tmp_a: {0}'.format(tmp_a))
        acc_list.append(tmp_a)
    return np.mean(acc_list)

hamming_score(y_true,y_pred)
```

`y_true` and `y_pred` are arrays of arrays where each column is a label indicator.
```python
# example of y_true or y_pred
array([[0,0, ... ,0,1],
	   [0,1, ... ,1,0],
	   ...

Observation data can contain some anomalies (for example, sensor breakdown, internet network loss...). The environment of the observation station can also induce errors of the records. In that case, they does not anymore represent well the meteorological reality at a given time (for example, the station is not very maintained and vegetation can cover partially the sensors). 
So it is why it is important to detect and correct observation data anomalies by crossing them with another sources like weather model forecasts, radar data or observation data from neighbouring stations.

METEO FRANCE produces several models to forecast the weather.

They compute a lot of weather parameters (temperature, wind speed, humidity...) at different points on the globe in 4 dimensions (latitude, longitude, height and time). 

It could be interesting to compare the forecasts to another data (radar, ground station observations…) to compute the forecasts errors. They could be taken into account into the future forecasts to improve them.

In meteorology, precipitation forecast is a major issue. In case of short term forecast, with a time horizon lower than 2 hours, it is usually called nowcast. Rainfall nowcast is known to be of major interest for severe events anticipation and for agriculture. Different rainfall forecasting methods are already available, ranging from sophisticated numerical weather prediction (NWP) models to simple extrapolation of images acquired by satellites or radars, often based on optical flow. Recently, the Deep Learning models have been shown to outperform these traditional methods, suggesting that IA has a huge potential for solving the problem.

The objective of this challenge is to predict time series by crossing different data sources. For example, you could predict a humidity time series of an observation ground station, using different data sources:
- the humidity history of the parameter to predict
- the other parameters of the observation ground station (temperature, pressure, wind...)
- other data sources : weather model forecasts, radar data

Nowcasting is a field of meteorology which aims at forecasting weather on a short term of up to a few hours. Cloud Cover is field of interest for meteorological organisations, for observation satellite management, to optimize their image shots,  and for solar panels management, to forecast their production of electricity. Put simply, at METEO FRANCE, a nowcasting product is a fusion of two approaches: pure data extrapolation techniques, which perform better on the very short term (up to 1 hour), and a mix between extrapolation and classical physical models  which remain the best option for further forecasting.  Recently, the Deep Learning models have been shown to outperform these traditional methods about Nowcasting, suggesting that IA has a huge potential for solving the problem.

Thunderstorms and floods are huge issues about the safety of persons and property. The radar images are a relevant source of data about precipitation. However, their spatial coverages remain limited (only for areas which could be covered by ground radars). The satellite images have the advantage of covering worldwide. Recently, Deep Learning models have been shown good performances to generate rainfall from satellite images, by choosing the radar images as ground thruth.

Chinese was written, for thousands of years without punctuation. Like, no comma, no stop, no question mark, no exclamation bar. In some cases stop characters are used, like: (者,也) 

Punctuating text while reading is a part of literacy training Chinese stop educating since we found the convenience of punctuations.

But when facing text OCRed from images of books and stone tablets, it will be much easier if we can have a model doing such chore.

Perform a consistent pattern of classifications / text extractions using the [Kaggle CORD-19 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge).  Create a notebook that automatically extracts the same information as the COVID-19 SOLES tables.   Specifically, we are trying to automate the manual classification / text extraction process that was used to create the `all_primary_data.csv` file within this dataset, except we want to use the Kaggle CORD-19 dataset as the data source because the Kaggle CORD-19 dataset is in a machine readable format (.JSON) and is updated on a frequent basis (there were more than 300 COVID-19 papers published per day during May 2020!)

For a ""getting started"" notebook, please refer to https://www.kaggle.com/davidmezzetti/cord-19-report-builder and https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/discussion/159849 and https://towardsdatascience.com/building-analysis-pipelines-with-kaggle-c745671d273e.  Note that this method will need to be adapted to work with the new table formats, described below.

## Expected Submission

**Article summary tables.  Specifically, the expected submission will be one or more .CSV files saved to the output folder of a Kaggle Notebook.  The .CSV files should contain summary tables that follow the table formatting that is both described and demonstrated in the file `all_primary_data.csv`.  


`[ 'objective', 'method', 'detail_method', 'subjects',
       'peer_reviewed', 'language', 'Url', 'DOI', 'Pdf', 'Link',
       'Author', 'Year', 'Title', 'Journal', 'Abstract', 'Volume',
       'Number', 'Pages', 'ISBN']`

To be valid, a [submission](https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/121068) must be contained in one or more Kaggle notebooks made public on or before the submission deadline. Participants are free to use additional datasets in addition to the [Kaggle CORD-19 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge), but those datasets must also be publicly available in order for the submission to be valid.  

An ideal submission will be able to: (1) recreate the target tables; (2) create new summary tables; and/or (3) append new rows to the old tables in order to add: (A) newly published articles; or (B) previously overlooked articles. Notebook authors should attempt to minimize the number of missing values within each new row while also attempting to avoid any errors or inaccuracies.  See the file `all_primary_data.csv` in this dataset for an example of what an article summary table might look like.

## Evaluation

**Submissions will be scored using the following grading rubric:**

Completeness (5 points)
 - Did the participant accomplish the task?
 - Are there missing values?
 - Bonus points for early submissions!

Accuracy (5 points)
 - Are the results relevant?

Media platforms such as social networks, media advertisement, information retrieval and recommendation systems deal with exponentially growing data day after day. Enhancing the relevance of multimedia occurrences in our everyday life requires new ways to organize – in particular, to retrieve – digital content. Like other metrics of video importance, such as aesthetics or interestingness, memorability can be regarded as useful to help make a choice between competing videos. This is even truer when one considers the specific use cases of creating commercials or creating educational content. Because the impact of different multimedia content, images or videos, on human memory is unequal, the capability of predicting the memorability level of a given piece of content is obviously of high importance for professionals in the field of advertising. Beyond advertising, other applications, such as filmmaking, education, content retrieval, etc., may also be impacted by the proposed task.

The task requires participants to automatically predict memorability scores for videos, that reflect the probability for a video to be remembered. Participants will be provided with an extensive data set of videos with memorability annotations, related information, and pre-extracted state-of-the-art visual features.

## Expected Submission
*See the [MediaEval 2020 webpage](https://multimediaeval.github.io/editions/2020/) for information on how to register and participate.*

* 15 October: Runs due 
* 15 November: Results returned  
* 30 November: Working notes paper  
* Early December: MediaEval 2020 Workshop 

## Evaluation
The ground truth for memorability will be collected through recognition tests, and thus results from objective measures of memory performance.

The outputs of the prediction models – i.e., the predicted memorability scores for the videos – will be compared with ground truth memorability scores using classic evaluation metrics (e.g., Spearman’s rank correlation).

Re-stocking products with the best potential is crucial for shops and businesses around the world.

Through this dataset and task, you are requested to build a model that can help predict *how well a product is going to sell*.

Such a model has *many implications* and could be used in many different ways, the most straightforward being to adjust how much of a product should be kept in stock.

This would allow you to better understand e-commerce sales and get you a certain expertise for helping businesses optimize their stocks and sales.


## Inspiration

- How about trying to validate the established idea of human sensitiveness to price drops ?
- You may look for top categories of products so that you know what sells best
- Do bad products sell ? How about the relationship between the quality of a product (ratings) and its success ? Does the price factor into this ?
- Do seller's fame factor into top products ?
- Do the number of tags (making a product more discoverable) factor into the success of a product ?


## Expected Submission

*What should users submit? Should they solve the task primarily using Notebooks or Datasets? What should the solution contain?*

You may solve this task using a notebook.


## Evaluation
*What makes a good solution?*

Your solution should **minimize the risks of**:

- *Buying way too much of a product*

- Ideally, identify products with a higher discount regarding the retail price. Practically, this means identifying products where the seller could increase his profit margin without losing too many buyers. See the concept of [Price Elasticity of the demande](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand)

- Lastly. There are always *a lot of product opportunities*, so *missing on a single opportunity is better than buying way too much* another product, since this might cancel out the profits gained elsewhere.


Your model will be evaluated on another similar dataset (same features&nbsp;and columns) to see how well it performs on new other data.

### Motivation

Online searches have become an important aspect of our daily lives as well as a key aspect for many businesses. Everyday, tons of searches are made all over the world, be it to get information, education or entertainment.
On the other end, businesses want to increase their exposure and visibility within this chaos, and are willing to pay fortunes to rank higher and stay on top.

In that regard, understanding how search trends evolve over time has become of central importance, as the desire to create a buzz is becoming mainstream.

### Tasks

Your goal will be to study how trends evolve over time and predict how the search traffic should evolve.


### Ideas

- You may want to study by country.
- You may want to study the impact of having a trend start in several countries
- You may want to consider the density of population of each country (number of people in a country) (and maybe also % of access to internet) since the more people a country has, the higher the number of interactions among friends and thus more repost/sharing.

- You may want to consider the language or the alphabet of a trending result.
   For instance, since english is an international language and quite easy to learn (compared to several other mainstream language), we may suppose that a trend or an article posted in english can be understood by more people, and thus more people can like it and share it.
   Conversely, a post written in Cyrillic or using the Chinese alphabet would not be understood in western countries, and thus the trend would stay or ""die"" in the neighbouring countries where it originated.

- You may want to approach searched terms by domain (like business, entertainment, social, news, ...) and group the results in clusters.


## Expected Submission
*What should users submit? Should they solve the task primarily using Notebooks or Datasets? What should the solution contain?*

You may contribute by submitting either one (or more) of those:
- using a notebook
- or a filtered version of the files in this dataset where you keep only the most interesting rows that denote your approach. This way, people will be able to build a model with the specific approach you took with your filtered data.
- or a dataset that can help complement this one and improve its quality


In all cases, an explanation of your approach will be much appreciated since it will allow others to better understand your contribution and give you proper credits !


## Evaluation
*What makes a good solution?*

Your submission should allow us to see how your model is validated against trends in the dataset.
Especially, the dataset contains trends that spanned over a few days (either because they grow over time or go down by losing the masses' interest).

Your submission should show examples of such trends and how they are handled (does your model help predict accurately these trends?)","","Build a model to predict the growth of search traffic","Study how top searches evolve over time","","0"

Creating a great seller profile is the dream of every inspiring influencer. However, the road to success is often unexplored because the amount of success is inversely proportional to the number of people who got to that level.

The idea with this dataset is to explore how seller profile mood messages relate to their level of success and –hopefully– discover what would make for a great seller profile status.

## Expected Submission
Ideally, it would be great to have contributions that show –for different levels of ""success""– what would be typical profiles look like.

This could be shown through a notebook, infographics, datasets or other forms.

## Note about a *Sucessful* profile
Note that the *success* of a seller is relative.
Since the dataset contains data about C2C sellers (customer-to-customer), you could choose to consider success:
- as the number of sold articles,
- or as the number of followers (since the more followers, the more sales potential a seller will have)","","Influencer-like profile ?","What paves the way to being an influencer ?","","0"

task-dummy.csv is the template of what is expected.  Simply replace`R_prob` and `B_prob` with the probabilities you think each fighter has of winning and upload that dataset.  The dummy dataset should already be uploaded as an example.

OR  

Feel free to submit a notebook that creates the properly formatted csv.  You can see how to do that here: https://www.kaggle.com/mdabbert/tutorial-prepare-a-prediction-task-submission


## Evaluation
Bets to be placed will be determined by the fighter's submitted probability and their closing betting odds.  Any bet that has a positive expected value will have a 100 unit bet placed on it.  The best submission is the submission who has the greatest return.  I created a kernel showing how expected value can be determined based off of odds and probabilities here: https://www.kaggle.com/mdabbert/tutorial-train-a-model-to-make-bet-predictions.

After the fights I will create a kernel evaluating every submission.  As an example,   here are the results for UFC 251:  https://www.kaggle.com/mdabbert/ufc-251-bet-prediction-contest-results

## Tutorial
Here is a step-by-step tutorial on how to create a submission by training a model: https://www.kaggle.com/mdabbert/tutorial-prepare-a-prediction-task-submission

## Tips
* If you want to just pick winners there is nothing stopping you from editing `task-dummy.csv` to have your choice of winner have a probability of `1` and the other fighter having a probability of `0`.  This will guarantee a bet on your chosen fighter for that match.

Submissions are due before the first fight starts.","","UFC Betting Contests - Ongoing - Put all Submissions Here","All future contest submissions from 2021-06-21 will be kept here","","2"

Your client is an Insurance company that has provided Health Insurance to its customers now they need your help in building a model to predict whether the policyholders (customers) from past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company.

For example, you may pay a premium of Rs. 5000 each year for a health insurance cover of Rs. 200,000/- so that if, God forbid, you fall ill and need to be hospitalised in that year, the insurance provider company will bear the cost of hospitalisation etc. for upto Rs. 200,000. Now if you are wondering how can company bear such high hospitalisation cost when it charges a premium of only Rs. 5000/-, that is where the concept of probabilities comes in picture. For example, like you, there may be 100 customers who would be paying a premium of Rs. 5000 every year, but only a few of them (say 2-3) would get hospitalised that year and not everyone. This way everyone shares the risk of everyone else.

Just like medical insurance, there is vehicle insurance where every year customer needs to pay a premium of certain amount to insurance provider company so that in case of unfortunate accident by the vehicle, the insurance provider company will provide a compensation (called ‘sum assured’) to the customer.

Building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue. 

Now, in order to predict, whether the customer would be interested in Vehicle insurance, you have information about demographics (gender, age, region code type), Vehicles (Vehicle Age, Damage), Policy (Premium, sourcing channel) etc.

## Overview

Welcome to the House Price Prediction Challenge, you will test your regression skills by designing an algorithm to accurately predict the house prices in India. Accurately predicting house prices can be a daunting task. The buyers are just not concerned about the size(square feet) of the house and there are various other factors that play a key role to decide the price of a house/property. It can be extremely difficult to figure out the right set of attributes that are contributing to understanding the buyer's behavior as such. This dataset has been collected across various property aggregators across India.  In this competition, provided the 12 influencing factors your role as a data scientist is to predict the prices as accurately as possible.

Also, in this competition, you will get a lot of room for feature engineering and mastering advanced regression techniques such as Random Forest, Deep Neural Nets, and various other ensembling techniques.

**Help Notes:**
1. It is a classification problem.
2. The file has 500001 lines.
3. The first column is source. This column gives us the label for every row of entries. The label can have value - 0,1,2,3,4. So there are 5 possible labels (the five robots.)
4. The features here are the sequence of 10 numbers. For each row it is num1, num2, num3, num4, num5, num6, num7, num8, num9, num10. Thus 10 numbers. 
5. In this classification problem your input while testing/validating your model with be a sequence of 10 numbers - i.e. any row from the datasets (without the first column) and the output will be predicted source having potential values - 0,1,2,3,4 (which will mostly be one hot encoded making them like 10000,01000,00100,00010,00001)
6. You will be training and testing your model on not a single input sequence, but a train of inputs, traditionally the x-train. And your labels (the first column here) would sit in a y-train. 
7. Also, the dataset is big, don’t try to use all data, sample it out. Make training, test and validation trains out of it.","","Develop an ML model that predicts the robot from their sequence with a good accuracy","","","2"

The classes are drawn from the urban sound taxonomy. For a detailed description of the dataset and how it was compiled please refer to our paper. All excerpts are taken from field recordings uploaded to www.freesound.org. The files are pre-sorted into ten folds (folders named fold1-fold10) to help in the reproduction of and comparison with the automatic classification results reported in the article above.
*Why use CNN*
This is a very classical way of sound classification as it is observed that similar type of sounds have similar spectrogram. A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of sound or another signal as they vary with time. And thus we can train a CNN network that takes these spectrogram images as input and using it tries to generalize patterns and hence classify them.

Create a baseline of the speech recognition using the Free Spoken Digit Dataset (FSDD)

## Expected Submission
Submit a notebook that implements the full lifecycle of data preparation, model creation and evaluation. Feel free to use this dataset plus any other data you have available. Since this is not a formal competition, you're not submitting a single submission file, but rather your whole approach to building a model.

The notebook should be well documented and contain:

Any steps you're taking to prepare the data, including references to external data sources
Training of your model
Select Model
An evaluation of your model. Let's keep it simple and measure the accuracy in this classification task.

## Evaluation
This is not a formal competition, so won't be measure the results strictly against a given validation set using a strict metric. Rather, what everyone like to see is a well-defined process to build a model that can deliver decent results (evaluated by yourself).

1. **Accuracy** - How well does the model perform on the dataset?
 Can it be generalized over time? 
Can it be applied to other scenarios? 
Was it overfit?
2. **Data Preparation** - How well was the data analyzed prior to feeding it into the model? Are there any useful visualizations? Does the reader learn any new techniques through this submission? A great entry will be informative, thought provoking, and fresh all at the same time.
3. **Documentation** - Are your code, and notebook, and additional data sources well documented so a reader can understand what you did? Are your sources clearly cited? A high quality analysis should be concise and clear at each step so the rationale is easy to follow and the process is reproducible.

As presented in the paper ""Automatic Detection of Sexist Statements
Commonly Used at the Workplace,"" an F1 score of 0.88 was attainable using GloVe embeddings fed into 2 BiLSTM layers with Dropout on top of which was a simple attention layer. 
Avenues for possible improvement involve preprocessing the dataset beyond removing stop words, introducing more complex attention mechanisms, using Google BERT word/phrase embeddings, among others.

## Expected Submission
Users should submit a notebook outlining any preprocessing and modeling steps that led to their performance. Additional analysis on the explainability of model to results are encouraged: Why did the model mark a statement as sexist? What specific words tipped off the model to marking a statement as sexist?

## Evaluation
We are looking for F1 performances that beat 0.88. All submissions will be judged based on their F1 performance. Precision and recall should be detailed as well since previous iterations of this model tend to exhibit better recall than precision, meaning that the model tends to over-label statements as sexist. A more balanced precision and recall will make for a better use case in the workplace.","","Improve Classification Performance","Beat an F1 score of 0.88","","0"

The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. I came across this useful data from [DOT's database](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Tables.asp?DB_ID=120&DB_Name=Airline%20On-Time%20Performance%20Data&DB_Short_Name=On-Time) at working and figured this would be a really helpful dataset: Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flight. However, the DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report only entails plots of the percentage of weather delay, security delay and others in a pie chart, rather than providing the real figure. So here, the dataset is provided after my work is finished; aside from that, you could also gather some weather information to complete your study. 



## Expected Submission
The expected submission could be a simple jupyter notebook, consisting of time predictions or time delay prediction on each airline. Additionally, you can also pair the flight information to each airport, each main airline company or other meaningful groups to rank what you recommend choose under what specific situation.

A few weeks ago, I received a request from a client on one of the freelance exchanges to create a tool that could recognize the gender of the owner by the name of the email address.
Looking for a few ready-made solutions, I was surprised that there is still no decent open source solution. After which I suggested Em to train his own neural network, which would do an excellent job. Since he was interested in recognizing email addresses exclusively for owners from the countries of the former CIS, I completed the task very quickly, it was simple. But I was interested in the question whether there is a clear line between men and women in the name of the email address, regardless of region, country, language or any other factors. In this task, you are provided with over 100,000,000 addresses belonging to people from different countries of the regions and points of the planet marked distinguished by gender.

## Expected Submission
To achieve the goal, you can use any material that you find on the Internet. The main goal is to predict gender by email regardless of other conditions, country, religion, age, mother tongue, etc.

## Evaluation

One of them, the “Lifetime Post Consumers” model, was assessed using sensitivity analysis to understand how each of the seven input features influenced it (category, page total likes, type, month, hour,
weekday, paid). The type of content was considered the most relevant feature for the model, with a relevance of 36%. A status post captures around twice the attention of the remaining three types (link, photo, video).We have drawn a decision process flow from the “Lifetime Post Consumers” model, which by complementing the sensitivity analysis information may be used to support manager's decisions on whether to publish a post.","","Predicting social media performance metrics","","","5"

It was guarded by around 11,500 Grenztruppen, the Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic who were authorised to use any means necessary, including firearms, to prevent border breaches.

# Outlier Analysis 
You must perform the Outlier Analysis on the dataset.
However, you do have the flexibility of not removing the outliers if it suits the
business needs or a lot of countries are getting removed. 
Hence, all you need to do is find the outliers in the dataset, and then choose whether to keep them or remove them depending on the results you get.

# Clustering
K-means and Hierarchical clustering(both single and complete
linkage) on this dataset to create the clusters. [Note that both the methods
may not produce identical results and you might have to choose one of them
for the final list of countries.]
Analyse the clusters and identify the ones which are in dire need of aid. You
can analyse the clusters by comparing how these three variables - [gdpp,
child_mort and income] vary for each cluster of countries to recognise and
differentiate the clusters of developed countries from the clusters of
under-developed countries.

# Visualisation
Also, you need to perform visualisations on the clusters that have been
formed. You can do this by choosing any two of the three variables
mentioned above on the X-Y axes and plotting a scatter plot of all the
countries and differentiating the clusters. Make sure you create visualisations
for all the three pairs. You can also choose other types of plots like boxplots,
etc.

# Results Expected
Both K-means and Hierarchical may give different results because of previous
analysis (whether you chose to keep or remove the outliers, how many
clusters you chose, etc.) Hence, there might be some subjectivity in the final
number of countries that you think should be reported back to the CEO since
they depend upon the preceding analysis as well. 
### Here, make sure that you report back at least 5 countries which are in direst need of aid from the analysis work that you perform.","","K-Means & Hierarchical Clustering","","","6"

This dataset contains the voting record of all 435 congressmen in the House of Representatives for 16 key issues. In this task, we're interested in answering the question: can we confidently predict what party a congressperson belongs to given only their voting record on 16 issues?

If it is possible to identify congresspeople with high confidence given the 16 issues, I believe another interesting task to look at will be: what is the minimal spanning set of voting record issues you would need to see before having a high confidence in a congressperson's party affiliation. 

## Expected Submission
The submission for this competition should be as a Notebook, which will build a predictive model or clustering that can take in a list of voting records on the 16 issues and then output a prediction on party affiliation. Then, you should draw a conclusion as to whether or not you can make a high confidence prediction on party affiliation just based on this voting record. 

## Evaluation
In order to evaluate success, please split your training and validation data randomly with a 65%-35% split. So, you will use observations from 65% of the data to assess if you can make high confidence predictions in the balance 35%.

- Guidance on ways to scale up NPIs in a more coordinated way (e.g., establish funding, infrastructure and authorities to support real time, authoritative (qualified participants) collaboration with all states to gain consensus on consistent guidance and to mobilize resources to geographic areas where critical shortfalls are identified) to give us time to enhance our health care delivery system capacity to respond to an increase in cases.
- Rapid design and execution of experiments to examine and compare NPIs currently being implemented. DHS Centers for Excellence could potentially be leveraged to conduct these experiments.
- Rapid assessment of the likely efficacy of school closures, travel bans, bans on mass gatherings of various sizes, and other social distancing approaches.
- Methods to control the spread in communities, barriers to compliance and how these vary among different populations..
- Models of potential interventions to predict costs and benefits that take account of such factors as race, income, disability, age, geographic location, immigration status, housing status, employment status, and health insurance status.
- Policy changes necessary to enable the compliance of individuals with limited resources and the underserved with NPIs.
- Research on why people fail to comply with public health advice, even if they want to do so (e.g., social or financial costs may be too high).
- Research on the economic impact of this or any pandemic. This would include identifying policy and programmatic alternatives that lessen/mitigate risks to critical government services, food distribution and supplies, access to critical household supplies, and access to health diagnoses, treatment, and needed care, regardless of ability to pay.

## Expected Submission

**Article summary tables.  Specifically, the expected submission will be one or more .CSV files saved to the output folder of a Kaggle Notebook.  The .CSV files should contain summary tables that follow the table formatting that is both described and demonstrated in the folder that is titled `target_tables`.  For this specific task, article summary tables should follow the table formatting: `Group 1 - Population`.**  


`Date	Study	Study Link	Journal	Study Type	Addressed Population	Challenge	Solution	Measure of Evidence	Added on	DOI	CORD_UID`


There should be one .CSV file per target table (and one or more .CSV file per notebook), and the title of the .CSV files should be the same as the titles of the target tables.  It may be advantageous to extract larger excerpts instead of specific values and, likewise, it may be advantageous for values to be prefixed by a human-readable indication of the location of that same value within the full-text document (in square brackets [] to facilitate error-checking). 

To be valid, a [submission](https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/121068) must be contained in one or more Kaggle notebooks made public on or before the submission deadline. Participants are free to use additional datasets in addition to the official Kaggle dataset, but those datasets must also be publicly available in order for the submission to be valid.  Previous versions of the article summary tables can be found in the folder that is titled `target_tables`.  

An ideal submission will be able to: (1) recreate the target tables; (2) create new summary tables; and/or (3) append new rows to the old tables in order to add: (A) newly published articles; or (B) previously overlooked articles. Notebook authors should attempt to minimize the number of missing values within each new row while also attempting to avoid any errors or inaccuracies.  See the [Kaggle COVID-19 Contributions](https://www.kaggle.com/covid-19-contributions) page for an example of what an article summary table might look like.

Participants must also accept the [competition rules](https://www.kaggle.com/cord-19-rules-accept-form).  Please note that you will have to fill out a new rules acceptance form for Round #2 even if you have already filled out a rules acceptance form for Round #1.

## Expected Submission

**Article summary tables.  Specifically, the expected submission will be one or more .CSV files saved to the output folder of a Kaggle Notebook.  The .CSV files should contain summary tables that follow the table formatting that is both described and demonstrated in the folder that is titled `target_tables`.  For this specific task, article summary tables should follow the table formatting: `Group 2 - Relevant Factors`.**  


`Date	Study	Study Link	Journal	Study Type	Factors	Influential	Excerpt	Measure of Evidence	Added on	DOI	CORD_UID`



There should be one .CSV file per target table (and one or more .CSV file per notebook), and the title of the .CSV files should be the same as the titles of the target tables.  It may be advantageous to extract larger excerpts instead of specific values and, likewise, it may be advantageous for values to be prefixed by a human-readable indication of the location of that same value within the full-text document (in square brackets [] to facilitate error-checking). 

To be valid, a [submission](https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/121068) must be contained in one or more Kaggle notebooks made public on or before the submission deadline. Participants are free to use additional datasets in addition to the official Kaggle dataset, but those datasets must also be publicly available in order for the submission to be valid.  Previous versions of the article summary tables can be found in the folder that is titled `target_tables`.  

An ideal submission will be able to: (1) recreate the target tables; (2) create new summary tables; and/or (3) append new rows to the old tables in order to add: (A) newly published articles; or (B) previously overlooked articles. Notebook authors should attempt to minimize the number of missing values within each new row while also attempting to avoid any errors or inaccuracies.  See the [Kaggle COVID-19 Contributions](https://www.kaggle.com/covid-19-contributions) page for an example of what an article summary table might look like.

Participants must also accept the [competition rules](https://www.kaggle.com/cord-19-rules-accept-form).  Please note that you will have to fill out a new rules acceptance form for Round #2 even if you have already filled out a rules acceptance form for Round #1.

Our teacher gave us the task to use the data in dataset to test the model only, and they did not tell how to train the model. First, What i done is that, i used to predict the order of one genome using the trainng model of ther genome. Example: I train the model using plasmid data and then using this model i try to predict the order of other genome assembler ( hamburgensis) but the order prediction is not between (1-10). The predicted orders got are in thousands and negative hundreds. So what i do is that i used the same data for training as well as testing by train the model and serialize it and then de-serialize the same model for prediction which is not a good practice .Give me the solution or suggestion how to deal with it.

Your task is to predict the purchased coverage options using a limited subset of the total interaction history.

Please read the Description of this dataset first.

Let's start from the most basic prediction task - use one or multiple sensor readings to predict the flow meter reading. 

Why flow meter reading, because it is the most simple feature that could be understood and explained easily. It directly links to the manufacturing process condition or process quality. If the flow rate is too low, then the core process will not be supplied with sufficient material and may cause product defect. 

The manufacturing team would normally decide the maintenance activity according to the flow meter reading: if the flow is below a defined threshold, then replace the filter. However, the degradation of the filter is not the only source of the risks. Everything connected within the pipeline may reduce or stop the flow, such as the failure of the pump, leakage of the valves. To narrow down the scope, in this case, we only focus on the equipment and sensors introduced in the dataset.

To make the use case more vivid, image when Easter or Christmas is coming, the maintenance manager wants to know how likely the production line would have equipment failure (continue process facility would not be shut down during holidays, even no part will be produced at holidays). So now it is your task, to predict the flow meter reading for the coming holiday (say at least 3 days).  Based on your prediction result, the maintenance manager would decide whether to add one maintenance action before the holiday.

Before you offered the power of prediction (via machine learning), the maintenance manager normally asks some staff to visit the shop floor during the holiday. The night's watch may not fully enjoy the holiday, and they may not visit the shop floor every day. If something got wrong, and the night's watch found it too late or react too late, you may find that the leaked fluid has flooded the entire shop floor.  

So, you'd better make the prediction work, and accurately.
 

## Expected Submission

You should submit a notebook that illustrates your approach to which able to predict flow sensor readings (FM1) in the next 3 days, based on the past 14 days records.

You may able to carry out the time-series forecasting with 

1. univariate input (past sensor readings), single-step output (predict the sensor reading at 72 hours ahead)
2. univariate input (past flow sensor readings), multiple-step output (predict the sensor reading from current to next 72 hours, every 30 min)
3. multivariate input (the record from multiple sensors), single-step output (predict the sensor reading at 72 hours ahead)
4. multivariate input (the record from multiple sensors), multiple-step output (predict the sensor reading from current to next 72 hours, every 30 min)


## Evaluation

The result can be judged by Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The smaller MAPE, the better.

## Hint

- CNN, RNN, LSTM and their combination stacking can be used here for time-series forecasting. 
- if you are using RNN kind Deep Learning methods, you probably would use the sliding window technique.  
- If you have no idea of which features to be included as the multivariate input, try all features at first.
- Try with or without feature engineering.


## Advanced tasks:

1. You can verify the size of the sliding window and prediction window. Could you find the minimum sliding window size and the maximum prediction window size while keeping an acceptable accuracy?
2. Normally we take the first 70% samples for training and validation, and the rest 30% samples for test. Is this the best way to distribute training and testing sets for a time-series dataset?
3. Anomaly detection and classification can also be applied to this dataset. We may create new tasks with additional information for anomaly detection and classification soon.

Note that a research article can possibly have more than 1 topic. The research article abstracts and titles are sourced from the following 6 topics: 

1. Computer Science

2. Physics

3. Mathematics

4. Statistics

5. Quantitative Biology

6. Quantitative Finance

Sentiment analysis remains one of the key problems that has seen extensive application of natural language processing. This time around, given the tweets from customers about various tech firms who manufacture and sell mobiles, computers, laptops, etc, the task is to identify if the tweets have a negative sentiment towards such companies or products.
Sentiment analysis is contextual mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in source material, and helping a business to understand the social sentiment of their brand, product or service while monitoring online conversations. Brands can use this data to measure the success of their products in an objective manner. In this challenge, you are provided with tweet data to predict sentiment on electronic products of netizens.

## Expected Submission
What should users submit? Should they solve the task primarily using Notebooks or Datasets? What should the solution contain?

## Evaluation
The metric used for evaluating the performance of classification model would be weighted F1-Score.

### Further help

Data
train.csv - For training the models, we provide a labelled dataset of 7920 tweets. The dataset is provided in the form of a csv file with each line storing a tweet id, its label and the tweet.

test.csv - The test data file contains only tweet ids and the tweet text with each tweet in a new line.

sample_submission.csv - The exact format for a valid submission

Most profane and vulgar terms in the tweets have been replaced with “$&@*#”. However, please note that the dataset still might contain text that may be considered profane, vulgar, or offensive.

High Frequency trading in stock market is always challenging, here we want to build a autonomous trading pipeline which can be used to do high frequency trading with high portfolio


## Expected Submission
Please submit your notebook which includes your model and your profit


## Evaluation
There is some constraints on your model:
1. First it should be very fast since time is money for high frequency trading
2. Second, there is a limit on max Volume you can have. Eg: your cash can at most buy 10 at the same time.
3. There is a transaction fee for each buy and sell. For google stock, on average it's 0.005 per Volume.
4. Your model should be robust. Eg: You should train and test that on training and testing data that are independent of each other.
5. Remember: Traders don't do trading unless they are pretty sure about that. Thus, you model should buy and sell as few as possible.

The variables loaded are named ‘fault_free_training’, ‘fault_free_testing’, ‘faulty_testing’, and ‘faulty_training’, corresponding to the RData files.
Each dataframe contains 55 columns:
Column 1 (‘faultNumber’) ranges from 1 to 20 in the “Faulty” datasets and represents the fault type in the TEP. The “FaultFree” datasets only contain fault 0 (i.e. normal operating conditions).
Column 2 (‘simulationRun’) ranges from 1 to 500 and represents a different random number generator state from which a full TEP dataset was generated (Note: the actual seeds used to generate training and testing datasets were non-overlapping).
Column 3 (‘sample’) ranges either from 1 to 500 (“Training” datasets) or 1 to 960 (“Testing” datasets).

Your client is an Insurance company that has provided Health Insurance to its customers now they need your help in building a model to predict whether the policyholders (customers) from past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company.

An insurance policy is an arrangement by which a company undertakes to provide a guarantee of compensation for specified loss, damage, illness, or death in return for the payment of a specified premium. A premium is a sum of money that the customer needs to pay regularly to an insurance company for this guarantee.

For example, you may pay a premium of Rs. 5000 each year for a health insurance cover of Rs. 200,000/- so that if, God forbid, you fall ill and need to be hospitalised in that year, the insurance provider company will bear the cost of hospitalisation etc. for upto Rs. 200,000. Now if you are wondering how can company bear such high hospitalisation cost when it charges a premium of only Rs. 5000/-, that is where the concept of probabilities comes in picture. For example, like you, there may be 100 customers who would be paying a premium of Rs. 5000 every year, but only a few of them (say 2-3) would get hospitalised that year and not everyone. This way everyone shares the risk of everyone else.

Just like medical insurance, there is vehicle insurance where every year customer needs to pay a premium of certain amount to insurance provider company so that in case of unfortunate accident by the vehicle, the insurance provider company will provide a compensation (called ‘sum assured’) to the customer.

Building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue. 

Now, in order to predict, whether the customer would be interested in Vehicle insurance, you have information about demographics (gender, age, region code type), Vehicles (Vehicle Age, Damage), Policy (Premium, sourcing channel) etc.","","Janatahack: Cross-sell Prediction by analyticsvidhya.com","Janatahack: Cross-sell Prediction by analyticsvidhya.com","","0"

The FHFA House Price Index (HPI) is a broad measure of the movement of single-family house prices. The HPI is a weighted, repeat-sales index, meaning that it measures average price changes in repeat sales or refinancings on the same properties. This information is obtained by reviewing repeat mortgage transactions on single-family properties whose mortgages have been purchased or securitized by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac since January 1975.

The outbreak of Covid-19 is developing into a major international crisis, and it's starting to influence important aspects of daily life. For example:

- Travel: Bans have been placed on hotspot countries, corporate travel has been reduced, and flight fares have dropped.
- Supply chains: International manufacturing operations have often had to throttle back production and many goods solely produced in China have been halted altogether.
- Grocery stores: In highly affected areas, people are starting to stock up on essential goods.
A strong model that predicts how the virus could spread across different countries and regions may be able to help mitigation efforts. The goal of this task is to build a model that predicts the progression of the virus in 2020.

### Expected Submission
Submit a notebook that implements the full lifecycle of data preparation, model creation and evaluation. Feel free to use this dataset plus any other data you have available. Since this is not a formal competition, you're not submitting a single submission file, but rather your whole approach to building a model.

The dataset I chose is the affairs dataset that comes with Statsmodels. It 
was derived from a survey of women in 1974 by Redbook magazine, in 
which married women were asked about their participation in extramarital 
affairs. More information about the study is available in a 1978 paper from 
the Journal of Political Economy.


## Expected Submission

I decided to treat this as a  classification problem  by creating a new binary 
variable affair (did the woman have at least one affair?) and trying to 
predict the classification for each woman.



#description of dataset


The dataset is [affairs dataset](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/stable/datasets/generated/fair.html ""Affairs data"") and comes with [Statsmodels](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/ ""Statsmodels""). It was derived from a survey of women in 1974 by Redbook magazine, in which married women were asked about their participation in extramarital affairs. More information about the study is available in a [1978 paper](https://fairmodel.econ.yale.edu/rayfair/pdf/1978a200.pdf ""Affairs paper"") from the Journal of Political Economy.

### Description of Variables
The dataset contains 6366 observations of 9 variables:

   + `rate_marriage`: woman's rating of her marriage (1 = very poor, 5 = very good)
   + `age`: woman's age
   + `yrs_married`: number of years married
   + `children`: number of children
   + `religious`: woman's rating of how religious she is (1 = not religious, 4 = strongly religious)
   + `educ`: level of education (9 = grade school, 12 = high school, 14 = some college, 16 = college graduate, 17 = some graduate school, 20 = advanced degree)
   + `occupation`: woman's occupation (1 = student, 2 = farming/semi-skilled/unskilled, 3 = ""white collar"", 4 = teacher/nurse/writer/technician/skilled, 5 = managerial/business, 6 = professional with advanced degree)
   + `occupation_husb`: husband's occupation (same coding as above)
   + `affairs`: time spent in extra-marital affairs","","Extramarital Affairs Dataset","","","0"

This task is similar to the theme followed by the task that I released on 2021-03-26 [""Identify correlations between KPIs on UN SDG for EU 27""](https://www.kaggle.com/robertolofaro/sdgeu-datamart-sample/tasks?taskId=3867), focused on a subset of the UN KPI derived from the UN SDGs, but just for EU 27.

In this case, the task is to do something else- not just correlations, but (possibly visual) clustering of countries using the 33 KPIs that are included in this dataset extract from the World Bank, covering (for now) 2000-2019.

As an example, I shared within a Kaggle dataset ([Italy - shp files in CSV- from EEA and ISTAT](https://www.kaggle.com/robertolofaro/italy-shp-files-in-csv-from-eea-and-istat)) the SHP files (e.g. to be used with geopandas and others) that I had converted using GDAL for Italy: will share an example of its use within the next task (publication due on 2021-04-23)
 
The key element in this case is that there is plenty of data transformation to do, as the 33 indicators (actually 34, as the dataset contains also the GINI estimate by the World Bank) are quite heterogenous in content (both in terms of formats, presence of values, range).

For more details, you can visit the source website (see the [documentation of this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/robertolofaro/selected-indicators-from-world-bank-20002019)).


TO CONTINUE FROM THIS POINT
The aim is to 
1. identify clusters between KPIs (e.g. look at the discussion about the KPI IT_USE_ii99 within the 2019-12-30 article listed above)
2. find supporting datasets that are not within those that I already posted online
3. identify further tasks (or subtasks)
4. considering that the KPIs should be updated yearly, define and implement a pipeline that automates as much as possible activities (e.g. from scraping to cleaning/transformation to aggregation and presentation).

## Expected Submission

I plan to release some material by June 2021, and then identify if I should create other datasets, or implement the current dataset (as an example, I store locally also the press releases, but are not shown on the online database)

Anyway- if you post Notebooks suggesting other areas of development, I will see to include / amend further requirements, KPIs, etc

## Evaluation

I am interested (and working on) what can be repeatable, not linked to a single, specific event (albeit once in a while I use the database also to support my publications focused on specific events or ideas)

### Further help

As I am on a learning track since March 2020, I will routinely revise this section of this task, to add links that I found useful for the purposes stated above","","#FridayDataSetTask03 : Identify clustering of countries by World Bank indicators","use the subset of 33 indicators (+GINI estimate) to ""map"" clusters","","0"

Though there is no official dataset of games, there is a website (http://slippi.gg) called “Project Slippi” that contains links to game files in a custom “.slp” format. To this date, Project Slippi has games from 10 tournaments, each with varying total game counts from 51-8567. Our project will first need to scrape these “.slp” files, then process them into a more readable format such as a “.csv” file.  Professional matches often have a “hand warmer” stage before formal games, which allows competitors to practice for a while. This stage may heavily interfere with our model training, and is not labeled in any of the data, so we have to develop our own methods to detect and remove this type of data.  All recordings from Project Slippi are 60 frames per second (FPS). Due to the game’s mechanics, the distance of movement in 1 frame is limited, so using every frame has little benefit. Due to this, it is necessary to subsample the data to between 1-10 frames per second, as using every frame would be too noisy.","","Predict who wins","","05/01/2020 00:00:00","0"

**Data Set Information:**

This dataset has recordings of a gas sensor array composed of 8 MOX gas sensors, and a temperature and humidity sensor. This sensor array was exposed to background home activity while subject to two different stimuli: wine and banana. The responses to banana and wine stimuli were recorded by placing the stimulus close to the sensors. The duration of each stimulation varied from 7min to 2h, with an average duration of 42min. This dataset contains a set of time series from three different conditions: wine, banana and background activity. There are 36 inductions with wine, 33 with banana and 31 recordings of background activity. One possible application is to discriminate among background, wine and banana.

This dataset is composed of two files: HT_sensor_dataset.dat (zipped), where the actual time series are stored, and the HT_Sensor_metadata.dat, where metadata for each induction is stored. Each induction is uniquely identified by an id in both files. Thus, metadata for a particular induction can be easily found by matching columns id from each file.

We also made available python scripts to exemplify how to import, organize and plot our data. The scripts are available on GitHub:
[Web Link]

For each induction, we include one hour of background activity prior to and after the stimulus presentation. Time series were recorded at one sample per second, with minor variations at some data points due to issues in the wireless communication. For details on which sensors were used and how the time series is organized, see Attribute Information below.

The metadata stored in file HT_Sensor_metadata.dat is divided in the following columns:

* id: identification of the induction, to be matched with id in file HT_Sensor_dataset.dat;
* date: day, month and year when this induction was recorded;
* class: what was used to generate this induction (wine, banana or background);
* t0: time in hours in which the induction started (represents the time zero in file HT_Sensor_dataset.dat);
* dt: interval that this induction lasted.


**Attribute Information:
**
The dataset is composed of 100 snippets of time series, each being a single induction or background activity. On total, there are 919438 points. For each induction, the time when the stimulus was presented is set to zero. For the actual time, see column t0 of the metadata file. In file HT_Sensor_dataset.dat, each column has a title according to the following

* id: identification of the induction, to be matched with id in file HT_Sensor_metadata.dat;
* time: time in hours, where zero is the start of the induction;
* R1 â€“ R8: value of each of the 8 MOX sensors resistance at that time;
* Temp.: measurement of temperature in Celsius at that time;
* Humidity: measurement of humidity in percent at that time.


Temperature and humidity were measured using the Sensirion SHT75. The 8 MOX sensors are commercially available from Figaro, and are detailed below:
R1: TGS2611
R2: TGS2612
R3: TGS2610
R4: TGS2600
R5: TGS2602
R6: TGS2602

With rising healthcare costs, healthcare fraud is a major contributor to these increasing healthcare costs.

Try out various unsupervised techniques to find the anomalies in the data.

**Detailed Data File:**

The following variables are included in the detailed Physician and Other Supplier data file (see Appendix A for a condensed version of variables included)).

**npi** – National Provider Identifier (NPI) for the performing provider on the claim. The provider NPI is the numeric identifier registered in NPPES.

'AE' = 'Armed Forces Europe'
'AP' = 'Armed Forces Pacific'
'AS' = 'American Samoa'
'GU' = 'Guam'
'MP' = 'North Mariana Islands'
'PR' = 'Puerto Rico'
'VI' = 'Virgin Islands'
'ZZ' = 'Foreign Country'

**nppes_provider_country** – The country where the provider is located, as reported in NPPES. The country code will be ‘US’ for any state or U.S. possession. For foreign countries (i.e., state values of ‘ZZ’), the provider country values include the following:
AE=United Arab Emirates IT=Italy
AG=Antigua JO= Jordan
AR=Argentina JP=Japan
AU=Australia KR=Korea
BO=Bolivia KW=Kuwait
BR=Brazil KY=Cayman Islands
CA=Canada LB=Lebanon

HU= Hungary SY=Syria
IL= Israel TH=Thailand
IN=India TR=Turkey
IS= Iceland VE=Venezuela

**provider_type**  – Derived from the provider specialty code reported on the claim. 

**medicare_participation_indicator** – Identifies whether the provider participates in Medicare and/or accepts the assigned assignment of Medicare allowed amounts.

**place_of_service** – Identifies whether the place of service submitted on the claims is a facility (value of ‘F’) or non-facility (value of ‘O’). Non-facility is generally an office setting; however other entities are included in non-facility.

## Preprocessing
1.Check for null values in the data. Get the number of null values for each column.
Drop records with nulls in any of the columns. 

Variables seem to have incorrect type and inconsistent formatting. You need to fix them: 

Size column has sizes in Kb as well as Mb. To analyze, you’ll need to convert these to numeric.
Extract the numeric value from the column
Multiply the value by 1,000, if size is mentioned in Mb

Reviews is a numeric field that is loaded as a string field. Convert it to numeric (int/float).

Installs field is currently stored as string and has values like 1,000,000+. 
Treat 1,000,000+ as 1,000,000
remove ‘+’, ‘,’ from the field, convert it to integer

Price field is a string and has $ symbol. Remove ‘$’ sign, and convert it to numeric.

 ## Sanity checks:

Average rating should be between 1 and 5 as only these values are allowed on the play store. Drop the rows that have a value outside this range.

Reviews should not be more than installs as only those who installed can review the app. If there are any such records, drop them.

For free apps (type = “Free”), the price should not be &gt;0. Drop any such rows.

##  Performing univariate analysis: 
Boxplot for Price
Are there any outliers? Think about the price of usual apps on Play Store.

Boxplot for Reviews
Are there any apps with very high number of reviews? Do the values seem right?

Histogram for Rating
How are the ratings distributed? Is it more toward higher ratings?

Histogram for Size

Note down your observations for the plots made above. Which of these seem to have outliers?

## Outlier treatment: 

Price: From the box plot, it seems like there are some apps with very high price. A price of $200 for an application on the Play Store is very high and suspicious!

Check out the records with very high price
Is 200 indeed a high price?
Drop these as most seem to be junk apps

Reviews: Very few apps have very high number of reviews. These are all star apps that don’t help with the analysis and, in fact, will skew it. Drop records having more than 2 million reviews.

Installs:  There seems to be some outliers in this field too. Apps having very high number of installs should be dropped from the analysis.

Find out the different percentiles – 10, 25, 50, 70, 90, 95, 99

Decide a threshold as cutoff for outlier and drop records having values more than that

## Bivariate analysis:
 Let’s look at how the available predictors relate to the variable of interest, i.e., our target variable rating. Make scatter plots (for numeric features) and box plots (for character features) to assess the relations between rating and the other features.

Make scatter plot/joinplot for Rating vs. Price
What pattern do you observe? Does rating increase with price?
Make scatter plot/joinplot for Rating vs. Size
Are heavier apps rated better?
Make scatter plot/joinplot for Rating vs. Reviews
Does more review mean a better rating always?
Make boxplot for Rating vs. Content Rating
Is there any difference in the ratings? Are some types liked better?
Make boxplot for Ratings vs. Category
Which genre has the best ratings?

For each of the plots above, note down your observation.

## Expected Submission
I'm specifically looking for one analysis and your opinion on something else. 

1. Projections for Q4 of 2020 (oct-dec).  What should we expect based on data from previous years?  A list of sales per item type would be ideal. I'm selecting this date range with the expectation the corona virus won't still be a global pandemic.

2. Would you expect any pent-up demand?  Would you recommend any discounts based on previous data?

3.  Any other analysis would be so incredibly helpful.

Recently there has been quite a lot of talk around the relationship between the countryside communities and those in large cities, and Stockholm in particular [(https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/hatet-mot-stockholmare-vaxer-genuin-frustration/)]((https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/hatet-mot-stockholmare-vaxer-genuin-frustration/)).

An important question to consider therefore is how much of the spread in other communities is caused by travelling city folk and could this lead to similar outbreaks in other parts of the country?

This task thus looks to model the outbreak in regions outside the three largest cities (Stockholm, Västra Götaland and Skåne) from 1 April 2020 to 1 May 2020. 

## Expected Submission
Submit a suitable notebook, and not simply a submission file. 

The notebook should be well documented and contain:

- Data preparation and cleaning, including external references
- Training methodology of your model
- Your model results (see below)
- Evaluate your model against new data. Use Mean Absolute Error (or another metric which can be suitably justified).

With your model, you should produce an output table in the following format for the period specified.

**Region**: Region name
**Confirmed**: Cumulative number of confirmed cases
**Deaths**: Cumulative number of deaths cases

Recently there has been quite a lot of talk around whether Sweden's Coronavirus strategy is based on the idea of herd immunity, i.e. that a large portion of the population will get infected and then become immune to the virus, shielding others. This has been controversial to say the least https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/catastrophe-sweden-coronavirus-stoicism-lockdown-europe, and firmly denied by the Public Health Agency in Sweden. 

However, an important question to consider therefore is with the current rate of spread and the death rate, how many deaths are we expecting in the coming months if this does indeed become the official strategy?

This task thus involves modelling the number of expected deaths over time.

During the last years, the exponential growth of spreading misinformation throughout the social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook or Instagram have fostered applied research in order to detect and consequently prevent the intrusion of these kind of content in such networks. Thus, it is clear that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a crucial role in this topic in order to support these platforms in order to automatically notify or restrict the access to those accounts that look suspicious according to a certain set of descriptors or features.

As an example of this, in 2019, Twitter had to remove more than 26 thousand of accounts since they were suspicious of spreading misinformation and/or non-appropriate content. So then, the question is, how AI may support end-users in the task of detecting suspicious accounts?

The objective of the task is to classify whether a user account is suspicious to be a bot considering the available set of features provided in the dataset (Additional feautures can also be collected to promote the performance of the systems). 

To do so, the datasets provides a response variable denoted as account_type which contains a binary label to distinguish between human and bot accounts.","","Detecting Bots in Twitter via AI","","","0"

The outbreak of Covid-19 is developing into a major international crisis, and it's starting to influence important aspects of daily life. For example:

- Travel: Bans have been placed on hotspot countries, corporate travel has been reduced, and flight fares have dropped.
- Supply chains: International manufacturing operations have often had to throttle back production and many goods solely produced in China have been halted altogether.
- Grocery stores: In highly affected areas, people are starting to stock up on essential goods.

A strong model that predicts how the virus could spread across different countries and regions may be able to help mitigation efforts. The goal of this task is to build a model that predicts the progression of the virus throughout March 2020.

## Expected Submission
Submit a notebook that implements the full lifecycle of data preparation, model creation and evaluation. Feel free to use this dataset plus any other data you have available. Since this is not a formal competition, you're not submitting a single submission file, but rather your whole approach to building a model.

With this model, you should produce a table in the following format for all future days of March (similar to **covid_19_data.csv**)

- ObservationDate: Observation date in mm/dd/yyyy
- Province/State: Province or State
- Country/Region: Country or region
- Confirmed: Cumulative number of confirmed cases
- Deaths: Cumulative number of deaths cases
- Recovered: Cumulative number of recovered cases

The notebook should be well documented and contain:

1. Any steps you're taking to prepare the data, including references to external data sources
2. Training of your model
3. The table mentioned above
4. An evaluation of your table against the real data. Let's keep it simple and measure Mean Absolute Error.


## Evaluation

This is not a formal competition, so we won't measure the results strictly against a given validation set using a strict metric. Rather, what we'd like to see is a well-defined process to build a model that can deliver decent results (evaluated by yourself).

However, for declaring winners(if any), we'll be looking at -

- Accuracy - How well does the model perform on the real data? Can it be generalized over time? Can it be applied to other scenarios? Was it overfit?
- Data Preparation - How well was the data analyzed prior to feeding it into the model? Are there any useful visualizations? Does the reader learn any new techniques through this submission? A great entry will be informative, thought provoking, and fresh all at the same time.
- Documentation - Are your code, and notebook, and additional data sources well documented so a reader can understand what you did? Are your sources clearly cited? A high quality analysis should be concise and clear at each step so the rationale is easy to follow and the process is reproducible.","","Predict the Spreading of Coronavirus","Can we help mitigate the secondary effects of covid-19 by predicting its spread","","1"

"989","678816","4507744","05/27/2020 23:00:14","An active discussion about the mortality data in Moscow has erupted in the days.
The Moscow Times newspaper drew attention to a significant increase in official mortality rates in April 2020:
""Moscow recorded 20% more fatalities in April 2020 compared to its average April mortality total over the past decade, according to newly published preliminary data from Moscow’s civil registry office.
The data comes as Russia sees the fastest growth in coronavirus infections in Europe, while its mortality rate remains much lower than in many countries. Moscow, the epicenter of Russia’s coronavirus outbreak, has continued to see daily spikes in new cases despite being under lockdown since March 30.
According to the official data, 11,846 people died in Russia’s capital in April of this year, roughly a 20% increase from the 10-year average for April deaths, which is 9,866. The numbers suggest that the city’s statistics of coronavirus deaths may be higher in reality than official numbers indicate.
Russia boasts a relatively low coronavirus mortality rate of 0.9%, which experts believe is linked to the way coronavirus-related deaths are counted.""

After this publication have been realesed The Moscow Department of Health has denied the statement of the inaccuracy of counting.:

First, Moscow is a region that openly publishes mortality data on its websites. Moscow on an initiative basis published data for April before the federal structures did it.
Secondly, the comparison of mortality rates in the monthly dynamics is incorrect and is not a clear evidence of any trends. In April 2020, indeed, according to the Civil Registry Office in Moscow, 11,846 death certificates were issued. So, the increase compared to April 2019 amounted to 1841 people, and compared to the same month of 2018 - 985 people, i.e. 2 times less.
Thirdly, the diagnosis of coronavirus-infected deaths in Moscow is established after a mandatory autopsy is performed in strict accordance with the Provisional Guidelines of the Russian Ministry of Health.Of the total number of deaths in April 2020, 639 are people whose cause of death is coronavirus infection and its complications, most often pneumonia.It should be emphasized that the pathological autopsy of the dead with suspected CoV-19 in Russia and Moscow is carried out in 100% of cases, unlike most other countries.It is impossible to name the cause of death of COVID-19 in other cases. For example, over 60% of deaths occurred from obvious alternative causes, such as vascular accidents (myocardial infarction and stroke), stage 4 malignant diseases (essentially palliative patients), leukemia, systemic diseases with the development of organ failure (e.g. amyloidosis and terminal renal insufficiency) and other non-curable deadly diseases.
Fourth, any seasonal increase in the incidence of SARS, not to mention the pandemic caused by the spread of the new coronavirus, is always accompanied by an increase in mortality. This is due to the appearance of the dead directly from an infectious disease, but to an even greater extent from other diseases, the exacerbation of which and the decompensation of the condition of patients suffering from these diseases also leads to death. In these cases, the infectious onset is a catalyst for the rapid progression of chronic diseases and the manifestation of new diseases.
Fifthly, a similar situation with statistics is observed in other countries - mortality from COVID-19 is lower than the overall increase in mortality.
According to the official sites of cities:In New York, mortality from coronavirus in April amounted to 11,861 people. At the same time, the total increase in mortality compared to the same period in 2019 is 15709.In London, in April, 3,589 people died with a diagnosis of coronavirus, while the total increase was 5531
Sixth, even if all the additional mortality for April in Moscow is attributed to coronavirus, the mortality from COVID will be slightly more than 3%, which is lower than the official mortality in New York and London (10% and 23%, respectively). Moreover, if you make such a recount in these cities, the mortality rate in them will be 13% and 32%, respectively.
Seventh, Moscow is open for discussion and is ready to share experience with both Russian and foreign experts.","","Statisitc analys","Can you confirm or refute the theory of falsification of statistics on mortality from covid in Moscow?","","2"

All of the images in this dataset contain GPS metadata, allowing you to identify where they were taken. Can you predict the location without using this metadata though, based purely on the image content?

For example, you might look at the skyline and match distinctive features to an elevation model... Or perhaps you might use OCR to read road signs and work out where you might be from those... Or perhaps you'll spot a bus number, and identify a route that the image must have been taken on... Or perhaps you'll spot some flora or fauna that only grows in a certain part of Scotland...

There are many different ways this task can be tackled, and different approaches will be best suited to different situations. We're interested in all automatic approaches, even if they only work on a subset of the images or just narrow down the search area.

## Example Use Case
An example defence use case for this capability is locating hostages based on videos or photos sent by captors.

In this use case, analysts are likely to only have one or two images to work from, and may not accurately know the time the image was taken.","","Geolocation of Images","Identify image location based on content","","0"

At Shopee, we always strive to ensure the correct listing and categorization of products. For example, due to the recent pandemic situation, face masks become extremely popular for both buyers and sellers, every day we need to categorize and update a huge number of masks items. A robust product detection system will significantly improve the listing and categorization efficiency. But in the industrial field, the data is always much more complicated and there exist mislabeled images, complex background images, and low-resolution images, etc. The noisy and imbalanced data and multiple categories make this problem still challenging in the modern computer vision field.

Due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic across the globe, many individuals are increasingly turning to online platforms like Shopee to purchase their daily necessities. This surge in online orders has placed a strain onto Shopee and our logistics providers but customer expectations on the timely delivery of their goods remain high. On-time delivery is arguably one of the most important factors of success in the eCommerce industry and now more than ever, we need to ensure the orders reach our buyers on time in order to build our users’ confidence in us.

In order to handle the millions of parcels that need to be delivered everyday, we have engaged multiple logistics providers across the region. Only the best logistics providers that are able to meet Shopee’s delivery standards are partnered with us.

The performance of these providers is monitored regularly and each provider is held accountable based on the Service Level Agreements (SLA). Late deliveries are flagged out and penalties are imposed on the providers to ensure they perform their utmost.

The consistent monitoring and process of holding our logistics providers accountable allow us to maintain our promise of timely deliveries to our buyers.

## Tasks
Identify all the orders that are considered late depending on the Service Level Agreements (SLA) with our Logistics Provider.

For the purpose of this question, assume that all deliveries are considered successful by the second attempt.


## Basic Concepts

-   Each orderid represents a distinct transaction on Shopee.

-   SLA can vary across each route (A route is defined as Seller’s Location to Buyer’s Location) - Refer to SLA_matrix.xlsx

-   Pick Up Time is defined as the time when the 3PL picks up the parcel and begins to process for delivery. It marks the start of the SLA calculation.

-   Delivery Attempt is defined as an attempt made by the 3PL to deliver the parcel to the customer. It may or may not be delivered successfully. In the case when it is unsuccessful, a 2nd attempt will be made. A parcel that has no 2nd attempt is deemed to have been successfully delivered on the 1st attempt.

-   All time formats are stored in epoch time based on Local Time (GMT+8).

-   Only consider the date when determining if the order is late; ignore the time.

-   Working Days are defined as Mon - Sat, Excluding Public Holidays.

-   SLA calculation begins from the next day after pickup (Day 0 = Day of Pickup; Day 1 = Next Day after Pickup)

**2nd Attempt must be no later than 3 working days after the 1st Attempt, regardless of origin to destination route**  (Day 0 = Day of 1st Attempt; Day 1 = Next Day after 1st Attempt).

Only consider the date when determining if the order is late; ignore the time.

Assume the following Public Holidays:

1.  2020-03-08 (Sunday);
2.  2020-03-25 (Wednesday);
3.  2020-03-30 (Monday);
4.  2020-03-31 (Tuesday)

## Submission Format

Check each delivery order and determine whether it is late.

Two columns required:

-   orderid.
-   is_late: assign value 1 if the order is late, otherwise 0.

| orderid | is_late |
| ------- | --- |
| 1955512445 | 0 |
| 1955598428 | 1 |

#### Your submission should have 3,176,313 rows (excluding headers), each with 2 columns.

## Examples

| 2nd Attempt Time | NaN                                                                                                                                                                              |

Based on the SLA matrix:

- Luzon -&gt; Metro Manila: 1st Attempt must be within 5 days from Pick Up Time.
This means the Logistics Provider has up to 2020-03-07 to attempt a delivery. This order is deemed as late.

Calculating the Days

Day 0 = 2020-03-02 (Pick Up Time)
Day 1 = 2020-03-03 
Day 5 = 2020-03-07 
Day 6 = 2020-03-09 (we exclude 2020-03-08 from the calculation because it is a Sunday)

Based on the SLA matrix:

- Luzon -&gt; Metro Manila: 1st Attempt must be within 5 days from Pick Up Time
- 2nd Attempt must be within 3 days from the 1st Attempt

This order has a 1st Attempt within 5 days. However, the 2nd Attempt is 4 days from the 1st Attempt (we exclude Sundays from the calculation). This order is deemed late.

## Scoring Metrics
Matthews Correlation Coefficient

### Evaluation Description
Matthews Correlation Coefficient takes into account true and false positives and negatives and is generally regarded as a balanced measure that can be used even if the classes are of very different sizes.[2] The MCC is in essence a correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted binary classifications; it returns a value between −1 and +1. A coefficient of +1 represents a perfect prediction, 0 no better than random prediction and −1 indicates total disagreement between prediction and observation.

The MCC can be calculated directly from the confusion matrix using the formula:
![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F4614224%2F20360df230604529478983468697fdb1%2FCapture.JPG?generation=1596428531142443&alt=media)

In this equation, TP is the number of true positives, TN the number of true negatives, FP the number of false positives and FN the number of false negatives. If any of the four sums in the denominator is zero, the denominator can be arbitrarily set to one; this results in a Matthews correlation coefficient of zero, which can be shown to be the correct limiting value.","","Logistics Performance","E-Commerce Logistics: Data Analytics Challenge","","4"

At Shopee, we always strive to ensure the customer’s highest satisfaction. Whatever product is sold on Shopee, we ensure the best user experience starting from product searching to product delivery, including product packaging, and product quality. Once a product is delivered, we always encourage our customers to rate the product and write their overall experience on the product landing page.

The rating and comments provided for a product by our buyers are most important to us. These product reviews help us to understand our customer's needs and quickly adapt our services to provide a much better experience for our customers for the next order. The user's comments for a product ranges from aspects including delivery services, product packaging, product quality, product specifications, payment method, etc. Therefore it is important for us to build an accurate system to understand these reviews which have a great impact on overall Shopee’s user experience. This system is termed: ""Shopee Product Review Sentiment Analyser"".

**Note: This page is for participants from the student group!**

## Task

In this competition, a multiple product review sentiment classification model needs to be built. There are ~150k product reviews from different categories, including electronics, furniture, home & living products like air-conditioner and fashion products like T-shirts, rings, etc. For data security purposes, the review ids will be desensitized. The evaluation metrics are top-1 accuracy.

"1573","810142","4614224","08/03/2020 04:51:02","## Background

At Shopee, we have customers and sellers across Southeast Asia and Taiwan. In order to provide a better shopping experience, we set up the cross border business to improve the variety of products for our customers. In order to help the local sellers to migrate the SKUs to different foreign markets, we hire a group of professional human translators with e-commerce background to take care of the product translation. The product information translated includes product title, variation, and description. However, as Shopee is growing tremendously in recent years, the amount of translation per day is beyond the human translators’ capacity. At the same time, with the development of AI technology, machine translation is now deployed in many industrial areas to assist the human translators and they can achieve a near-human level translation quality.

In Shopee, we have an in-house machine translation pipeline which can translate millions of SKUs per week in different languages. The languages include Traditional Chinese, Bahasa, English, Vietnamese, Thai, and Portuguese. The challenges in machine translation are usually the lack of labeled data. However, different ways of unsupervised machine translation have been explored and proven to be effective, with little or even no label data. Some techniques are cross-lingual word alignments or pre-trained cross-lingual language models.

## Task

Given a product title in Traditional Chinese, the candidate is expected to translate the title into English.

Dataset: Candidates are provided with two monolingual product title data (in Traditional Chinese and English). The use of public data is encouraged.

Metrics: Bleu score of the whole test set is used to assess the translation quality.

The aim of this project is to build a model that can predict whether a user opens the emails sent by Shopee.

Sending emails is one of the marketing channels Shopee uses to reach out to our users. Being able to predict whether a user opens an email allows Shopee to forecast and evaluate the performance of future marketing campaigns before launch. This is because when a user opens an email, the probability of the user knowing the campaign increases and this in turn increases the probability of the user making a checkout during the campaign period. Therefore, with the predicted open rates, Shopee can better develop, strategize and implement future marketing campaigns.

## Task

We provide you with data related to marketing emails (Electronic Direct Mail) that were sent to Shopee users over a certain period. It contains information about

-   User-specific information

-   Email nature

-   Users’ engagement on the platform

-   User’s reaction to the email, including whether users opened the email

Based on the data provided, you must predict whether each user will open an email sent to him/her.

## Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated on the [Matthews correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthews_correlation_coefficient) (MCC) between the predicted and the observed response. The MCC is given by:

There’s good news today for people hoping that politicians will just declare victory against the coronavirus—or whatever they think they need to say—and let us have our economy back. A Nobel Prize-winning chemist is encouraged by the latest global infection and mortality data. Some state governments are moving toward economic revival. And new research raises more questions about a series of virus models which have influenced the decisions of nervous politicos.

As for the need to liberate Americans to pursue their livelihoods, University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan has a new website tracking the massive daily economic cost of the virus response. Of course the news contained in his charts is awful, but combined with other research it may help flatten the curve of belief in popular virus predictions.

On this point, this column recently noted the work of researchers at Australia’s University of Sydney, working with colleagues at America’s Northwestern and the University of Texas at El Paso. They detailed some of the flaws in predictions made by the oft-quoted Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), which has become famous for its coronavirus forecasts.

Today the team from Sydney, Northwestern and UTEP is publishing a new update to its working paper. Unfortunately the IHME predictions may not be getting any better, and in some ways may actually be getting worse. In their new evaluation of the predictive performance of the IHME models, the researchers report:

To assess the accuracy of the IHME models, we examine both forecast accuracy using tools from the econometric literature, as well as the predictive performance of the 95% prediction intervals provided by the IHME models. We find that the initial IHME model underestimates the uncertainty surrounding the number of daily deaths substantially. Specifically, the true number of next day deaths fell outside the IHME prediction intervals as much as 70% of the time, in comparison to the expected value of 5%. In addition, we note that the performance of the initial model does not improve with shorter forecast horizons.

Pro football scouts often say that if a quarterback is not an accurate passer when he enters the National Football League, he is unlikely to become one during his career. Perhaps a similarly healthy skepticism should be applied by politicians when consulting academic forecasters. According to the team critiquing the IHME.","","Curve Crushing","http://pandemiccosts.com/?modtag=djemBestOfTheWeb","","0"

The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.

## Expected Submission
The following 2 files are to be uploaded.

**test_predictions.csv** - This should contain the 0/1 label for the tweets in test_tweets.csv, in the same order corresponding to the tweets in test_tweets.csv. Each 0/1 label should be in a new line.

In my [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/pcbreviglieri/predicting-smart-grid-stability-with-deep-learning) deep learning was employed to predict smart grid stability from simulated data. Accuracy levels in excess of 97% were obtained with a simple artificial neural network. More complex models may improve such performance - that's your task.

## Evaluation
Focus on reaching at least 99% accuracy levels with your solution.

The Lockdown helped us see what a lot of prediction models could/would have predicted about cutting vehicular movement for a few weeks. 

There are groups of activists appealing to the Government to declare a day in the month as a cycle day and promote cycling. Other appeals include designating a few areas as a no-vehicle-zone on certain days.

The effects we want to achieve, are the ones that are, in part, indicated by the data collected during the lockdown.

**Why SilkBoard? **
The area around the Central Silk Board  sees the movement of lakhs of vehicles every single day. Most of the people who work in South Bangalore, are in some way required to cross the traffic junction at Silk Board sometime.  This area is a representation of the traffic volumes that Bangalore sees, and even though many projects have been undertaken to solve traffic congestion, the traffic density keeps rising, as in most parts of Bangalore.
This place is a major traffic intersection and a major source of pollution is in the form of vehicular traffic. We saw a major change in its scenery during the lockdown. 

## Expected Submission

1. The effect of a lockdown on the air quality parameters, against the data that contains measurements from February, about 6 weeks before the lockdown.
2. Model driven observations and suggestions, about what would be required to create the similar pollution curbing effects with minimum interference on vehicular traffic.
3. Data driven suggestions on what all data driven arguments could be presented, in order to keep our air cleaner at Central Silk Board, Bangalore.

## Evaluation

A good solution would be one that would predict similar air quality measurement trends, in a usual day, without a lockdown, but with some tweaks in vehicular movement or other administrative intervention.

A good solution would also include any other sources of data or links of such that could add a dimension of argument towards solutions.

I will be adding more data added in the coming few days, to include more dimensions to this problem.  Apart from being open to ideas, I am looking to include data about vehicular movement, year on year respiratory related illnesses reported in South Bangalore.","","Analyse the pollution trend at Central Silk Board, Bangalore during lockdown","","10/01/2020 23:59:00","0"

In the absence of immunity, the only way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is to provide a physical barrier or distance between humans. Governments, corporations and other bodies have made various announcements, implemented shut down or distancing laws, deployed enforcements of varying duration and [stringency](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) to try to limit human-to-human contact and disease spread.

A large number of ""natural experiments"" have occurred across the planet in the last 3 months, testing various distancing efforts and their effects on key population health outcomes including case counts, hospitalizations, critical care admission, mortality and immunity. 

This task aims to find relationships between distancing efforts and public health outcomes. This is important now for a few reasons:
1. Policy-makers need feedback. COVID-19 happened quickly. Some acted swiftly and with great might. Some did not. Which strategy worked?
2. As we pass the peak in many jurisdictions, the question on everybody's mind is how to we open up. If we can keep some distancing measures will relaxing others, perhaps we can limit the impact on return to jobs and the economy.
3. We will likely see a future of oscillations between disease spread and containment. Which interventions can we use and expect what impact?

## Starting point suggestions 
- There is a lot not known about COVID-19 and Canada's response. Basic descriptive entries are encouraged. This could include visualization of NPIs over time by region or an estimate of reproductive number over time.
- Consider the timing and stringency of interventions as important features (they are not all the same). Scoring government responses based on these two features would be interested.
- Look for reference jurisdictions where public health outcomes were positive (South Korea, Singapore) and less fortunate (Italy, Spain, New York) to anchor your analysis.
- Consider model parameters of ""the curve"" as target variables, including reproductive number, rate of spread, and doubling time.
- Consider mobility data as a marker of early societal response to distancing interventions.
- Simulation of the effects of different distancing measures on health and economic outcomes could be pursued by expert participants.

If we could instantly test every single person in Ontario, we would have complete information and could selectively isolate a tiny portion of the population and allow the rest to return to work. On the flip side, with no testing, complete lock down is the only strategy that prevents health system collapse - devastating the economy.

Inspired by early work of Paul Romer, this task asks the question: how do testing properties and tracing strategies impact the number of people who must remain isolated versus return to work? Amongst other things, he modeled 2 policies: random isolation versus testing + isolation and measured the proportion of a simulated population (dots in a box) that would have to be removed from the workforce to keep cumulative infection below a critical threshold.

This inspires further thinking along these lines: Should we be swabbing the nasopharynx of only symptomatic people with a test with 20% false negative rate to determine who should be isolated (without overloading the healthcare system)? Should we random sample a large population? What level of return to work would the use of instant testing and perfect cell phone tracing enable?

This kind of guidance around testing, tracing and isolation will help decision-makers understand how many of what kinds of tests to procure and deploy with what kind of logistics and policy. The more relevant to Ontario for this challenge, the more impactful.

## Suggestions to get started
- Explore the lag time of various read world testing techniques (minutes v days) and tracing strategies (phone calls v tracing)
- Consider constraints / boundaries related to total allowable number of cases (Ontario), total ICU bed use or mortality.
- Consider creating an interactive model

Hello!! I'm looking to create some interesting data visualizations and metrics around a set of about 200 stock market predictions. I have about 200 raw predictions and access to an API for historical data, and I'd like to make some compelling visualizations about the effectiveness. Would this be the type of project you'd be suited for? as an example this website does a similar display, https://www.aistockfinder.com/back-testing, Main goal is to specifically, would be nice to know average return in 1 day, 1 week, and 1-month segmentations in the graph/chart form. Looking forward to your thoughts! Thanks.
The historical stock prices to create metrics around the predictions can use the API

**The goal is to display potential returns by day, week and month.for each prediction**

So for a given prediction, I'd like to see how much potential gain in a day, week, or month. So traders who use those time-frames can understand the probability of success.

I was dealing with the fact that there are too many genres to fully understand, so a more generalized approach was needed: Creating super-genres out of genres! In this task, you are expected to understand how clustering works, how a prediction is made, and the evaluation methods.

## Expected Submission
In this task, the submission notebook should be clearly demonstrating:
- Which clustering approach did you choose
- Which hyperparameters did you tune (Optional)
- How accurate your prediction is (Silhouette score)
Additionally, it is a lot fancier if you publish your super-genre groups via a json file. An exemplary json file seems like this:

&gt; {
  1: [Genres type 1],
  2: [Genres type 2],
  ...
}

## Evaluation
There is a trade-off in this task: If the number of super-genres is too low, then the each group has too many genres, which is a problem. If the number of super-genres is nearly as high as genres, then there is no difference in using super-genres. Also, the silhouette score should be relatively high. (in between 0.5 and 1 is well appreciated)

This task is an extension for my currently working genre-based recommender system. I am mostly looking for ways to extend the whole system by implementing other features. 

## Expected Submission
Hereby, you are expected to create an all-features-inclusive (genre: optional) content-based recommendation system which takes from user a list of artists with their own user-defined ratings (e.g. 0-10 or 0-100 scoring) and returns the top results (e.g. top 5 or top 10).  If you feel overwhelmed, build only a genre-based recommendation engine using linear algebra. At the end, you are supposed to submit your recommendation engine via a notebook. The complete list of tasks:

1. Decide on which features you want to include to your recommender system
2. Build your recommendation engine according to the expected criteria
3. Publish your kernel

## Evaluation
All engines returning reasonable results are well appreciated, there is no expected accuracy criteria. The only criteria is that you need to demonstrate your programming skills and your analytical thinking.

Reddit is an American social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website.

Registered members submit content to the site such as links, text posts, and images, which are then voted up or down by other members. Posts are organized by subject into user-created boards called ""subreddits"", which cover a variety of topics such as news, politics, science, movies, video games, music, books, sports, fitness, cooking, pets, and image-sharing. Submissions with more up-votes appear towards the top of their subreddit and, if they receive enough up-votes, ultimately on the site's front page. Despite strict rules prohibiting harassment, Reddit's administrators spend considerable resources on moderating the site.

As of May 2020, Reddit ranks as the 19th-most-visited website in the U.S. and in the world, according to Alexa Internet, with 55% of its user base coming from the United States, followed by the United Kingdom at 7.4% and Canada at 5.8%

Advertisement CTR prediction is the key problem in the area of computing advertising. Increasing the accuracy of Advertisement CTR prediction is critical to improve the effectiveness of precision marketing. In this competition, we release big advertising datasets that are anonymized. Based on the datasets, contestants are required to build Advertisement CTR prediction models. The aim of the event is to find talented individuals to promote the development of Advertisement CTR prediction algorithms.

##Competition Description
In this competition, we provide contestants the user behavior data of advertising tasks, basic advertisement attributes, and basic user information. Contestants are required to build Advertisement CTR prediction models based on the provided data. All the data have been masked to ensure optimal data security.

The basic datasets contain a training dataset and a test dataset. The training dataset provides the tag that specifies whether a user clicks an ad, where 1 indicates yes, and 0 indicates no. The testing dataset is used to calculate the AUC of the built models. Contestants need to provide the predictive click probability of each ad sample in the testing dataset.

Fertilizers are used daily by farmers and families to help crops and gardens grow. Whether for a small garden of flowers and plants, or a large farm with thousands of acres of crops, a wide range of fertilizers have been developed to help different crops grow in different soil and weather conditions.

Chemical ingredients help create fertilizers that promote plant growth and are cost effective, too.

All data that is collected during this task will support the work of the BCG Atlas team, and it will also help with the analysis of the second task of the hackathon. 
The current BCG data is stored in  file.  The task is to try to find snippets that answer some of these questions. All the questions are listed as columns. Specifically, we would like to get as many accurate answers as possible to the following questions, for as many countries or regions as possible:
- Which BCG strain over the years has been used in different countries since the creation of the vaccine and during what time periods?
- Who are or were the target group of the vaccine, and when and at what age were they vaccinated?
- Have revaccinations (boosters) been given and if yes, when and at what age?
 
In the following spreadsheet are listed a couple of sample records - [BCG policy data hackathon sample google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nrzrAy0vC43Iy9QaKA5pR83O3YW3I16pXFjnOt86j5I/edit#gid=67941157). The new records which were added in addition to the existing BCG data from ""BCG_world_atlas_data-2020.csv"" file are on line 3, 6 and 7 and are highlighted in green. Line 4 and 5 are part of the original ""BCG_world_atlas_data-2020.csv"" file. The first 4 columns are mandatory and the field “Is it from bcgatlas.org (Mandatory field)” should have the value “no” for all records that are added by the participants of the hackathon. 

## Expected Submission
The expected submission will be a copy of the ""BCG_world_atlas_data-2020.csv""  file saved in Kaggle. The file should contain additional rows for a number of countries with snippets that contain answers to a specific question of a given column.  There should be no more than 2 new rows (data sources) per country. The snippet length should not be longer than 350* characters. For each additional row that has been added apart from the snippet(s), the first four columns are mandatory and should also be updated. A manual review is highly recommended in order to make sure that the snippets of the 2 selected data sources contain information about the specified country.

Participants must also accept our [competition rules](https://www.kaggle.com/bcgvaccine/hackathon). 

## Evaluation
Submissions will be scored using the following grading rubric:
- How many answers for how many countries have been found?  
- Are the snippets relevant?   
- Is the methodology well documented and if the code easy to read and reuse?

The initiative is prompted by the suggestion that there may be a link between reduced rates of infection and lower case fatality rates associated with COVID-19 in [countries that recommend  BCG vaccine](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/emmm.202012661) for all as opposed to countries that recommend BCG only for specific high-risk groups. We hope that the analysis done as part of this task might help discover useful information about the [BCG - COVID-19 clinical trials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16ISrVB2OL9pOLLPyTRziciTjSwFH7RI-aVExadCJ25o/edit#gid=821329594).  For example, some insights that may come from this analysis is whether factors such as the strain of BCG, the age at which people have been vaccinated, revaccination, or how long ago people have been vaccinated are important. 
 
Using machine learning and other technologies, we hope to be able to provide support for the role of BCG vaccinations or an [alternative hypothesis](https://naturemicrobiologycommunity.nature.com/channels/2549-coronaviruses-past-present-and-future/posts/64892-universal-bcg-vaccination-and-protection-against-covid-19-critique-of-an-ecological-study). We would like to get answers to the following questions:
- Is BCG vaccination causally related to reduced COVID‐19 mortality or other factors like lockdown and average age of the population are responsible for the different mortality rates?
- If BCG vaccination reduces COVID-19 mortality, what are the key factors, for example:
- How long does the immunity engendered by BCG last after vaccination?
- Which BCG strain has been used?
- What is the optimal time to vaccinate?


## Expected Submission
The expected submission must be contained in one or more public notebooks before the submission deadline including the     publicly available data that has been used for the analysis as well as the result data in CSV format.

Due to various factors, daily-cases reports of COVID-19 in Indonesia are often late, can be 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, or even more. Thus, sometimes the daily-cases reports are accumulated data of cases from the previous days. This causes the data on daily-cases reports of COVID-19 in Indonesia cannot describe the real situation.

Therefore we need a model that can estimate the actual number of daily cases of COVID-19 in Indonesia.

## Expected Submission

To better reflect the innovative university programs, the Organizing Committee of the Second Conference of the Hanseatic League of Universities has formed a new university ranking system based on the 400 programs. Here on Kaggle, we are releasing 117 programs in text around 48 universities under the four categories mentioned below:  

1. Industrial applications, rather than the traditional ways of counting research papers and lecture-type teaching;
2. Value-creating startups and entrepreneurship, rather than a traditional focus on the number of jobs filled; 
3. Social responsibility, ethics, and integrity, rather than a focus on knowledge and skills just for material success; 
4. Student mobility and openness for exchange and collaboration between schools and across national borders, rather than an independent yet closed system.

## Task Details
At this stage, we are issuing a call for action to the world’s artificial intelligence experts to share their idea on how to develop the attached text data for the next rounds of projects next year to improve this ranking system using the Kaggle. 
Currently, this project has been conducted by expert surveys and text informational analysis manually. What we hope to achieve by opening up our data this year is to receive productive feedback from the experts on how qualitative assessments on universities’ innovative programs can be rendered globally at a massive scale. 
We believe a lot of these works are suitable for text mining. However, given this is an annual task, there must be a condition to measure within the annual time frame.
Also, a list of key criteria can be found under the Tasks section of this dataset. 

## Evaluation
1. Innovativeness: Evaluators should first look at how innovative the program is. This could be with the content of the program itself or with the process the institution has demonstrated in making their program more effective. The evaluators may consider one of these aspects or both.

2. Implementability: Although the program may be innovative, evaluators should also examine its Implementability or doability. This can be assessed by measuring the costs and benefits in initiating the program.

3. Impact: Evaluators should consider both the scope and intensity of the program. In terms of scope, it should be judged whether the impact has been limited to only one department, for example, or whether it has been widespread across the entire university. Additionally, the impact of the program can have a varying degree of intensity which must be weighed up carefully.","","Share ideas to improve the WURI ranking system","","","1"

You are invited to prove with data whether countries with better immunization rates fared better in the fight against CoViD or otherwise.

## Expected Submission
You are expected to analyse the immunization dataset with public CoViD datasets containing country-wise data and arrive at a conclusion whether these data are related or not through notebook submissions. [Please note that immunization data from UNICEF is available from 1980 only and not all data is available for all countries for all vaccine types/doses for all years. So it is meaningful to compare statistics only for people below 40 years as of 2020.]

- **I have almost completed the problem. I only need to create a submission.csv file for all the examples. The thing is, it is really very difficult to work on kaggle now because the notebook lasts 9hour and even after saving the model i was not able to reuse it in kaggle. So I need to train again, which takes many hours, and I am left with very less time to write code for creating the sumbission.csv file.  Apart from that now I won't be able to train because soon I will exhaust my GPU and tell me how can i possibly work on it now?**
You can choose to download the model after training and upload it again next time you want to move forward. You can also choose to save the model into your Google Drive. If you exhaust GPU hours, You can look at continuing training using Google Colab

- **I would like to report an error in ""train.csv"" file on kaggle dataset, column headers are messed up, it should be like this (in Image), please revise it, thank you!!!**
That is not an error. That is done deliberately. The dataset is intended to be cleaned before using it.

- **can i train my model offline and generate the csv file  then submit it through google doc link ?**
You can train it offline or using Google Colab, but the jupyter notebook link has to be shared via the Google Docs Link

- **I have a small query, can i use existing model and retrain them or should i design my own model?**
You are free to use any model that you wish. 

- **(External Data is not allowed it's a repository or library.) Does this line mean we cannot use any pre-trained models for our task?**
You can use pre-trained model, but you cannot use any additional datasets. 

- **Can I use any Opensource repository for reference ?**
Yes, any approach that delivers results for the given dataset, works.

- **do we have to make a model which will predict all 20 classes like all the types of mask etc. or just the classes : face_with_mask and face_no_mask. Because the title is Face mask detection model. Because at last, we have to detect if a person is wearing mask or not.**
We will only be checking for two classes: face_with_mask and face_no_mask. It is up to you how you want to train the model using the existing classes. 

- **Is it mandatory to create our own model for mask detection or we can use pre trained yolo model for detection and fine tune it on our dataset**
You can use pre-trained model, but you cannot use any additional datasets.

## Detailed General Instructions
- The dataset zip that is provided contains images and their corresponding labels in a CSV.
- The CSV labels&nbsp;are provided for all images except the first 1800 images. Which means that those are to be considered as test images.
- For the rest of the&nbsp;images, their corresponding labels are provided in the existing CSV.&nbsp;
- The candidate(s) are required to first train a model on the images for the label that is provided (Excluding the 1800 images that are unlabelled).
- Once a trained model is obtained, the task is to run inference on the first 1800 test images (whose labels are not provided) and save the model predictions in a CSV file, in the exact same format as the training CSV is provided. (The format can be found here: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/wobotintelligence/face-mask-detection-dataset?select=train.csv)).
- Once the CSV is generated, the candidate is required to submit&nbsp;the same via the Google Form, [Linked here](https://forms.gle/1io1bsypdFTdks646).
- If the candidate is unfamiliar with how to generate a CSV, he/she can refer to&nbsp;[My First Kaggle Submission - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68l47Zu4Yxg)&nbsp;or any other tutorials available online.

## Points to note:
- The dataset may require preprocessing and data cleaning
- Only two classes will be checked: with and without a mask. the candidate can choose to exclude the other classes,  merge the other classes, that is up the candidate.

The traditional approach to determine the size distribution of nanoparticles is to count manually and calculate the density and the size distribution. The disadvantage using [imageJ ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html)is you have to treat each image manually. Can we use the computer vision to automatically determine the size (nm) and the density (/cm^2) of nanoparticles?

The challenge part is to increase the precision and avoid the dusts. 

I expect to obtain a notebook, which can automatically treat the images and obtain the size and the density of nanoparticles with an error.  

In order to evaluate the notebook, you can download the images and use imageJ to count the nanoparticles. The results counted by ImageJ can be a reference.

You are on a mission to use this data and tell a story of user interactions with the Airbnb platform: switching devices, spending time on the platform, doing different actions, and effecting user outcomes.

### The challenge

We see a few tracks to the challenge. You are free to define yours. The ultimate goal is to build an interactive visualization that helps tell a compelling and crisp story of user behavior on Airbnb.

The time aspect of user interaction with Airbnb. How do the time spent on user sessions, and the intermediate actions taken by the user on his or her journey, relate to user outcomes? Is there seasonality to how users interact with the platform? Any favorite times in the day? Are there any user types defined by when and for how long they use the platform?

Devices and apps used to access the platform and their impact on user outcomes. Do users who use a few devices and apps to access the platform exhibit different patterns than those who use one or two? What is the dynamic of switching from one device/app to the next, how does it relate to user actions and outcomes?

Your track. Find your own way of looking at the data, and share it with the world!","","Data Analysis","","","1"

**The outbreak of Covid-19 has developed into a major international crisis, and it has severely impacted important aspects of daily life. For example:

Travel: Bans have been placed on hotspot countries, corporate travel has been reduced, and flight fares have dropped.
Supply chains: International manufacturing operations have often had to throttle back production and many goods solely produced in China have been halted altogether.
Grocery stores: In highly affected areas, people are starting to stock up on essential goods.
A strong model that predicts how the virus could spread across different countries and regions may be able to help mitigation efforts. The goal of this task is to build a model that predicts the progression of the virus throughout for the further months.

**Expected Submission
**Submit a notebook that implements the full lifecycle of data preparation, model creation and evaluation. Feel free to use this dataset plus any other data you have available. Since this is not a formal competition, you're not submitting a single submission file, but rather your whole approach to building a model.

With this model, you should produce a table in the following format for all future days of March (similar to covid_19_data.csv)

ObservationDate: Observation date in mm/dd/yyyy
Country: Country
Confirmed: Cumulative number of confirmed cases
Deaths: Cumulative number of deaths cases
The notebook should be well documented and contain:

Any steps you're taking to prepare the data, including references to external data sources
Training of your model
The table mentioned above
An evaluation of your table against the real data. Let's keep it simple and measure Mean Absolute Error.

**Evaluation
**This is not a formal competition, so we won't measure the results strictly against a given validation set using a strict metric. Rather, what we'd like to see is a well-defined process to build a model that can deliver decent results (evaluated by yourself).

Our team will be looking at:

Accuracy - How well does the model perform on the real data? Can it be generalized over time? Can it be applied to other scenarios? Was it overfit?
Data Preparation - How well was the data analyzed prior to feeding it into the model? Are there any useful visualizations? Does the reader learn any new techniques through this submission? A great entry will be informative, thought provoking, and fresh all at the same time.
Documentation - Are your code, and notebook, and additional data sources well documented so a reader can understand what you did? Are your sources clearly cited? A high quality analysis should be concise and clear at each step so the rationale is easy to follow and the process is reproducible.
This task is not strictly about getting the best submission score. Since it involves data that changes in real-time, the most accurate solution would only require uploading the real historic data on the last day of March, but that’s besides the spirit of this Task.

Stats are a way to gauge how a stand might stack up against the bunch but which stand among these stand above the rest?

The stats rating hierarchy is:

 None    &lt;   E    &lt;   D   &lt;    C   &lt;   B    &lt;    A    &lt;    Infi

The following are the 3 tasks:
1. Top 10 stands in their respective categories with their ratings (Compare with other stats in case of identical values).
2. Top 10 Stands with the best overall ratings with their ratings (Do not consider DEV for this).
3. Top 10 Stands with potentially best ratings with their ratings (Consider DEV for the changes in attributes but not for overall values)

** DEV criteria (for task 3):

* DEV is an interesting stat this can be considered as a supporting attribute. 
The way this stat would work is that it can be used to upgrade the rating of any other stat (to a max ranking of A) while reducing the rating of the DEV stat (Until value reaches E).
* None value cannot be increased.
* Stands with DEV infi can be used any number times to upgrade any stat upto a max of rating A
For eg consider the following attributes,

PWR=B SPD=B RNG=B PER=B PRC=B DEV=B

DEV can be used to boost 3 times from B--&gt; C--&gt; D--&gt; E

One form of updated attributes could be,

PWR=A SPD=A RNG=A PER=B PRC=B DEV=E (3 stats have been manipulated)

## Expected Submission
Provide solutions to these tasks in a notebook format.

## Evaluation
I Will not be checking it for any correct answers (Since I'm a noob at this as well 👀 ). But will definitely give my thoughts on your submissions. Who knows perhaps the community might share their views on this as well. 🙌

The brightness of a star is more or less determined by how far it is from us, and its spectral characteristics (i.e. color). Because we have fairly accurate measurements of distance thanks to Gaia, it should be possible to determine if a star is substantially dimmer or brighter than expected.

## Expected Submission
* The difference in brightness (in magnitudes) between what we observe and what we expected to observe.
* An standard error estimate. (The error may depend, for example, on parallax error and magnitude error.)

## Evaluation
Magnitude RMSE is what tells you how accurate the model is. But the point is not to get the most accurate machine learning model. It's up to the researcher to determine what the purpose of the model is. For example, you might include position features as part of the model, which would improve model accuracy, but it would dilute any regional anomalies, which may be of interest.

In this study, we (1) analyzed the effects of social-media exclusion adapting the Ostracism Online paradigm to a cohort of Italian preadolescents (Mage = 11.47, 53% girls) and (2) tested the efficacy of two potential recovery strategies (i.e., social bonds vs. social surrogate).

Method
Inclusionary status was manipulated through the number of “likes” participants received on a fictitious online social network. In the exclusion condition, participants received fewer likes than everyone else. In the inclusion condition, participants received a similar number of likes of other users. Then, all participants were asked to think of a significant positive relationship with a family member (social bonds), a celebrity (social surrogate), their present moment thoughts (control).","","Analyze id Preadolescents who received fewer likes than others","reported higher levels of need threat (i.e., belong, self-esteem, meaningful existence, but not control) and negative emotions","","2"

We updated the global dataset of historical yields for major crops (GDHY), which is a hybrid of agricultural census statistics and satellite remote sensing, to cover the 36-year period from 1981 to 2016, with a spatial resolution of 0.5°. Four major crops were considered: maize, rice, wheat and soybean. The updated version 1.3 was developed and then aligned with the earlier version 1.2 to ensure the continuity of the yield time series. Comparisons with different global yield datasets and published results demonstrate that the GDHY-aligned version v1.2 + v1.3 dataset is a valuable source of information on global yields. The aligned version dataset enables users to employ an increased number of yield samples for their analyses, which ultimately increases the confidence in their findings.","","Forecasting yields for major crops for next 10 years","Historical yields for major crops 1981–2016.","","2"

It centralizes power plant data to make it easier to navigate, compare and draw insights for one’s own analysis. The database covers approximately 30,000 power plants from 164 countries and includes thermal plants (e.g. coal, gas, oil, nuclear, biomass, waste, geothermal) and renewables (e.g. hydro, wind, solar). Each power plant is geolocated and entries contain information on plant capacity, generation, ownership, and fuel type. It will be continuously updated as data becomes available.

The methodology for the dataset creation is given in the World Resources Institute publication ""A Global Database of Power Plants"". Data updates may occur without associated updates to this manuscript.","","Visualize on Map the position of power plants around the world","","","0"

QA-pair retrievers also offer interpretable answers, a high degree of control, and are trivial to update at test time with new knowledge. However, these models lack the accuracy of retrieve-and-read systems, as substantially less knowledge is covered by the available QA-pairs relative to text corpora like Wikipedia. To facilitate improved QA-pair models, we introduce Probably Asked Questions (PAQ), a very large resource of 65M automatically-generated QA-pairs. We introduce a new QA-pair retriever, RePAQ, to complement PAQ. We find that PAQ preempts and caches test questions, enabling RePAQ to match the accuracy of recent retrieve-and-read models, whilst being significantly faster. Using PAQ, we train CBQA models which outperform comparable baselines by 5%, but trail RePAQ by over 15%, indicating the effectiveness of explicit retrieval. RePAQ can be configured for size (under 500MB) or speed (over 1K questions per second) whilst retaining high accuracy. Lastly, we demonstrate RePAQ's strength at selective QA, abstaining from answering when it is likely to be incorrect. This enables RePAQ to ``back-off"" to a more expensive state-of-the-art model, leading to a combined system which is both more accurate and 2x faster than the state-of-the-art model alone.","","Find similarity questions from this dataset","","","0"

"3773","1210792","18463","03/14/2021 17:12:26","The ProofWriter dataset contains many small rulebases of facts and rules, expressed in English. Each rulebase also has a set of questions (English statements) which can either be proven true or false using proofs of various depths, or the answer is “Unknown” (in open-world setting, OWA) or assumed negative (in closed-world setting, CWA).

The dataset includes full proofs with intermediate conclusions, which models can try to reproduce.

The dataset supports various tasks:

Given rulebase + question, what is answer + proof (w/intermediates)?
Given rulebase, what are all the provable implications?
Given rulebase + question without proof, what single fact can be added to make the question true?
Here is a simple example from the depth-2 dataset D2(OWA):

Rulebase:

triple1: The cow is big.  
triple2: The cow needs the dog.  
triple3: The dog sees the rabbit.  
triple4: The rabbit chases the cow.  
triple5: The rabbit chases the dog.  
triple6: The rabbit is big.  
triple7: The rabbit sees the dog.  
rule1: If the cow is blue and the cow needs the rabbit then the cow needs the dog.
rule2: If the cow chases the dog then the cow sees the rabbit.
rule3: If something is big then it chases the dog.
Question with answer + proof:

Question: The cow sees the rabbit?
Answer: true
Proof: (((triple1) -&gt; (rule3 % int2))) -&gt; (rule2 % int1) ; with int1 = The cow sees the rabbit. ; int2 = The cow chases the dog.
Generate all implications (only 2 in this case, can be as high as 21 in D5 theories):

All implications: The cow chases the dog. The cow sees the rabbit.
Use abduction to find a missing fact which will make something true:

Question to make true: The dog chases the dog.

As a legal representative of our bank, I'd like to make the case in court how fair and unbiased our models are so we're standing ground in front of a judge. We need this to win cases based foremost on GDPR and other banking regulations.

## Expected Submission
Build a model, which is proven fair and unbiased. For this, it must be globally and locally explainable how it came about some classifications (hint: SHAP). We also need to 
- define protected attributes like gender, age, etc., which may be subject to biases,
- define and use existing metrics for data and models with acceptable bounds for fairness.
(hint: AIF360)
Discuss on your findings. How does applying means of fairness affect your model performance? How does tuning your model for better AI metrics affect your ethical metrics?

## Evaluation
A good solution comes with 
- transparency to explain how specific classifications came about (Local Explainability -- hint: SHAP),
- transparency to explain how classifications came about in general (Global Explainability -- hint: SHAP),
- measurements to prove, the resulting forecasts are unbiased (regardless of formerly biased input data -- hint: AIF360)

Additionally, you may build a Causual Model with like DoWhy or Graphical AI Models (hint: PGMs & MRFs) to infer reason to other or these models. Graphical Models are hard to do correctly.

Recognizing handwritten digits using a variant of MNIST represents the most popular starter test for both new and established machine learning algorithms.  This grayscale (28x28 pixel) imagery provides another challenging object recognition task, labeling objects in overhead satellites.  To take advantage of the vast machine learning literature on digit recognition, we mirror the format of the original MNIST closely a and thus like other extensions (Fashion-MNIST), the goal is to provide the research community with a new drop-in replacement for benchmarking.   

For these 10,000 training and testing images (90:10 ratio), the original data was heavily processed as labeled objects in 10 classes (car, harbor, helicopter, oil_gas_field, parking_lot, plane, runway_mark, ship, stadium, storage_tank). The CSV has labels in alphabetic order (0-9) to mimic the digit recognizer classes. The data is balanced +/- 5% between the 10 classes with 1000 examples per class. Three different formats are provided for download, including comma-separated values files, JPEG images sorted by class (10 total), and the original MNIST binary format (idx-ubyte) from LeCun, et al.  These formatting options should cover most all published MNIST solutions with minimal modifications.

## Expected Submission
Users can solve the task primarily using Notebooks or Datasets.  

## Evaluation
A good solution includes a Notebook and a confusion matrix for multiple algorithm types ranging from linear regression, support vector machines, trees or deep learning methods.

Explore an image classification dataset consisting of 10 executable code varieties and approximately 50,000 virus examples. The malicious classes include 9 families of computer viruses and one benign set.  The image formatting for the first 1024 bytes of the Portable Executable (PE) mirrors the familiar MNIST handwriting dataset, such that most of the previously explored algorithmic methods can transfer with minor modifications. The designation of 9 virus families for malware derives from KMeans clustering that excludes the non-malicious examples. The work generalizes what other malware investigators have demonstrated as promising convolutional neural networks originally developed to solve image problems but applied to a new abstract domain in pixel bytes from executable files. 

## Expected Submission
Recent interest in applying the same techniques to anti-virus and malware detectors motivates the present work to score a similar formatted problem and compare the algorithmic performance.  The Portable Executable dataset contains 51,880 examples of the first 1024 bytes (32x32 pixel values) of the header along with its MD5 hash for the entire file and binary class label as either malware or not (e.g. beneware).  If formulated as a two-class problem, the imbalanced ratio of malware to beneware equals approximately 20:1 (49,364:2516).  Without rebalance, a 95% correct solution would simply declare all cases as malware. To recast the image dataset as a MNIST-formatted alternative, we performed a standard cluster analysis using the KMeans algorithm; we assigned cluster number equal to 9 based on the 1024 column byte vector but excluding the identifying file hash.  We attempted to assign dominant families to each derived cluster based on the known MD5 hashes but found multiple names and sample diversity when querying VirusTotal.  To reduce the amount of code changes comparing a larger or smaller multi-class problem with existing MNIST infrastructure, we opted to use the assigned 9-cluster result as a fully unsupervised example.

The use of convolutional neural networks for network attack classification depends on converting tabular feature sets into thumbnail images. This dataset renders the UNSW attack set as 256 pixel images (16x16). The categorical inputs are one-hot encoded and all numerical inputs are scaled from 0-255. The baseline UNSW dataset yields 194 values and the images are right padded with black (255) values for all labels.  The column labels are also shown for the train and test sets in CSV format.

3 years ago, I collected with a friend of mine some data from the web to train a fake news detector for french news articles and we had pretty good results. Recently, it just popped up to my mind to share with the community our dataset and let you build a better approach. 

## Expected Submission
The expected submission is a notebook in which you try to predict whether or not a news is fake. The prediction quality has to rely on the AUC (Area Under ROC). The training has to be done on the training dataset. 

## Evaluation
The AUC has to be computed on the test set. Greater is the AUC, better is your classification system.

As we have number of upvotes in the data  we can implement matrix factorization . 

- Also you might find similar users and books through  your pipeline. (e.g. 5 similar users with similarity score  )

## Expected Submission
Submit a notebook including recommendation in tabular format which recommend to each user  n ranked (e.g 5 or 10) books with  **predicted vote**.

## Evaluation

It depends on **Variants of Matrix Factorization** you apply. Basically  you should apply hold-out method , and evaluate you model on unseen test data. 

#### *Note :  When splitting up the data into training and test sets, you should randomly select (user, book) pairs, not select random users or books. The whole idea is the model be able to predict ratings for books user haven't seen based on the ratings  provided for ones you have. If a user is present only in the testing set, the model cannot possibly be basing predictions based on their other ratings.*

You are provided by buildings structure data with ""csv_building_structure.csv"" among data files. This file includes building structure data as well as damage_grade as target. 

We're trying to predict the ordinal target damage_grade, which represents a level of damage to the building that was hit by the earthquake. There are 5 grades of the damage with value_counts(): 

&gt;Grade 5    275766
&gt;Grade 4    183844
&gt;Grade 3    136412
&gt;Grade 2     87257
&gt;Grade 1     78815

The dataset mainly consists of information on the buildings' structure . Each row in the dataset represents a specific building in the region that was hit by Gorkha earthquake.



There are 31 columns in this dataset, where the building_id column is a unique and random identifier. 

You can use other data e.g.  'csv_building_ownership_and_use.csv',  'csv_household_resources.csv' and  'csv_household_demographics.csv' and join them using  'mapping.csv' data.

## Expected Submission

- Split you input data set to train , test for example by .20 test size and keep test data as unseen,   to be able  deliver score of you final model on test data
- Use KFold or StratifiedKfold cross validation on delivered train data for evaluation
-  As the data is imbalanced don't use 'accuracy' metric instead you can apply **micro averaged F1 score**

- This dataset is a good practice to apply several feature selection methods such as :

  * [x] Removing Low Variances
  * [x] Pearson Correlation
  * [x] Chi-2

Build an Image segmentation model that can detect the damages in Car.

## Expected Submission
Bounding boxes and segmentation arrays of the damages.

## Evaluation
This task is evaluated on the mean average precision at the different intersection over union (IoU) thresholds. The IoU of a proposed set of object pixels and a set of true object pixels is calculated as:

$$ IoU(A,B) = \frac{A \cap B}{ A \cup B} $$

The metric sweeps over a range of IoU thresholds, at each point calculating an average precision value. The threshold values range from 0.5 to 0.95 with a step size of 0.05: (0.5, 0.55, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95). In other words, at a threshold of 0.5, a predicted object is considered a ""hit"" if its intersection over union with a ground truth object is greater than 0.5.



At each threshold value t, a precision value is calculated based on the number of true positives (TP), false negatives (FN), and false positives (FP) resulting from comparing the predicted object to all ground truth objects:

$$ \frac{TP(t)}{TP(t) + FP(t) + FN(t)} $$

A true positive is counted when a single predicted object matches a ground truth object with an IoU above the threshold. A false positive indicates a predicted object had no associated ground truth object. A false negative indicates a ground truth object had no associated predicted object. The average precision of a single image is then calculated as the mean of the above precision values at each IoU threshold:

$$\frac{1}{|thresholds|} \sum_t \frac{TP(t)}{TP(t) + FP(t) + FN(t)}  $$","","Detect Damages","Image Segmentation for Car Damages","","8"

Over the past several months, the issue of “fake news” -- defined by the New York Times as “made-up
stories written with the intention to deceive” and published in formats similar to those of traditional “real”
news -- has arisen as a threat to high-quality journalism and well-informed public discourse. In particular,
fake news has been accused of increasing political polarization and partisan conflict in the United States
during the divisive 2016 presidential campaign and the early days of the Donald Trump administration.

The task is organized around the more well-defined problem of “stance detection,” which involves
comparing a headline with a body of text from a news article to determine what relationship (if any) exists
between the two. There are 4 possible classifications:
1. The article text ​ agrees with​ the headline.
2. The article text ​ disagrees with​ the headline.
3. The article text ​ is a discussion of​ the headline, without taking a position on it.
4. The article text ​ is unrelated to​ the headline (i.e. it doesn’t address the same topic).



## Expected Submission

A machine learning model which can be used to solve the stance detection problem with high accuracy might effectively be
used either as a tool for humans working to identify fake news (e.g., retrieving articles that agree, disagree
and discuss a headline), or as a building block for a more elaborate future AI system that would try to
identify the actual truthfulness of news stories

## Evaluation

The model thus created should be analyzed in all the parameters like precision,recall,and accuracy for each four classes as well as overall dataset.","","Creating a text  classification model for finding categorising similarity between two input text","Classify article headline and body similarity in four categories,agree,disagree,discuss,unrelated.","","0"

The legal language is very special in many regards compared to regular natural language. It is highly structured, rather complicated, contains its own special terms and uses certain words differently than they are used in regular text.

Text classification is simple to define but has a myriad of possible applications and good systems can provide immense value. Common general applications of text classification include for example:
- Spam filtering
- Email priority rating
- Topic classification
And in the legal domain:
- Legal judgement prediction (predict outcome of a case based on description of case's facts)
- Legal area prediction

So in this task, you will predict the court_id based on the text of a court decision. The court_id is structured in the form of {canton}_{court}_{chamber_number} (e.g. SG_KG_002 =&gt; St. Gallen, Kantonsgericht, 002).

Detecting the horse riding activity from the rider's movement pattern.

## Evaluation
The most important metric to evaluate against is the number of times the wrong activity is predicted. The second most important metric is the time a wrong activity is predicted.

For example if a 5 min segment was annotated as canter and this was predicted as canter, but with 4 shorter 10 second segments of trot this would mean 4 errors with an error time of 40 seconds.

The metric to beat (Equilabs current algorithm) is 562 errors with a total error time of 13 minutes in all the annotated trainings.

**Note 1**
*The exact timing of an activity is not that important and if a segment it does not have to . For example if the annotations indicate that canter started 100 seconds into the training, but the predicated canter activity started 103 seconds into the training it does not have to be counted as an error.*

**Note 2**
*It is fine for any activity to be predicted when the annotated activity is ""unknown"". Unknown is not an activity, but indicates it is unknown what activity the rider was doing at this time and could have been any of the other activities or even something else such as walking beside the horse etc.*","","Horse riding activity recognition","Detecting the horse riding activity from a smartphone sensor data","","1"

They’ve provided a sample of users that we know have bought tours from them in the past, which are saved as user_uids in conversion.csv. We would like to know which of the other users in our dataset are likely to be interested in their offers as well.

Create a model using an algorithm of your choice to predict holiday interest and populate the field p_conv in submission.csv with predictions for the respective user_uids given in the file.

- data.csv contains raw data with user_uids and associated “segments” (variables that represent what we know about these users). Each segment is identified by an ID and you will find a corresponding label in the taxonomy.csv file. The segments are also marked as P (when a user had the opportunity to click on an option in the quiz) and A (when the user actually clicked on an option in the quiz). Some segments are represented by binary variables, others by continuous variables.
- taxonomy.csv gives category labels for the variables in data.csv. Labels have an intrinsic hierarchy delimited by § characters.

Main task is to generate actionable insights from this pet food customer orders dataset. 
As a focus area, try to address the following questions: 

- Which customers order and reorder the wet food, and when are they likely to try it? 
- Are there certain characteristics of the pets, customers or their orders that impact how likely they are to purchase the wet food, and keep ordering it? 
- Based on this data, what do you suggest we focus on to get more customers taking and continuing to enjoy our wet food? 


## Data Intro
The data set is a selection of customers and their orders, with some pet characteristics and details of what they got in each order.

Orders are numbered in sequence for each pet and every order contains dry food, which is the core offering of all online pet food companies. Some customers also purchase wet food (the subject of this challenge) alongside their dry food and in this dataset you also have the wet food order sequence. So if a customer has 2 dry food only orders followed by an order containing dry and wet food, then they will have a row in this dataset with petordernumber = 3, and wetfoodorder_number = 1.

This customer order dataset is derived from a subscription business. If a pet has an active subscription, then the business will make and deliver an order every 31 days, which contains dry food and whatever other products a customer has on their subscription. A customer can remove wet food and treats from their orders and still keep an active subscription, the business will just continue to make and send them  their dry food.","","Insights from online pet food customer orders","","","2"

&gt; Music actors operate several tools to achieve high-quality musical artifacts. One of the typically used tools is the digital multi-effects processor, which applies a chain of non-linear transformations (effects) to audio signals. However, the large number of available configurations implies that better use of such equipment is restricted to specialists. In this context, intelligent systems for music production aim to propose automatic tools to ease and support decision making by music actors. -- Introduction of [Audio Plugin Recommendation Systems for Music Production](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8923658)

Suppose that a person has a Zoom G3 audio equipment. This person, are starting to creating a patch. Probably, the user doesn't knows the utility of all the audio plugins, then he only select some audio plugins and put they in specific positions.

A patch into the Zoom G3 is a sequence of N=6 audio plugins. This equipment has 117 audio plugins. Each audio plugin can be used in any position. Also, it's possible to use a same audio plugin in more than one position in a patch. In the following figure, each blocks correspond to the instances of the audio plugins in the position defined in the patch.

In this sense, create a recommendation system that recommends audio plugins from incomplete patch. You can try: 
 * Plugin recommendation on a single position (M = N-1);
 * Plugin recommendation on multiple positions (M &lt; N-1);

This task is represented on the following image (letter `a`).

## Expected Submission

Is expected solutions based on recommenders systems. The models can be trained from the `patches-filtered.csv` dataset. Try to create cool Notebooks for de system recommender. You can use the [Zoom G3 image plugins collection](https://github.com/SrMouraSilva/ZoomG3-Patches/tree/master/images) to enrich the visualization. You can also condition recommendations based on the plugins categories (see `plugins-categories.csv` file).

## Evaluation

We recommends this following metrics, [based on the original paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336830006_Audio_Plugin_Recommendation_Systems_for_Music_Production):

* **Hit**@k: Verifies if the expected item is within the top-k positions ([reference](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/502585.502627)). You can use `k=1` (standard accuracy) and `k=5`, where the number 5 was chosen as an acceptable number  of  plugins  that  a  user  would  evaluate  during  a patch configuration procedure;
* **MDCG** (Mean  Discounted  Cumulative  Gain):  Indicates how  close  an  item  is  in  the  first  positions  by  assigning greater  relevance  to  the  results  whose  expected  item  is in  the  top  positions.  The  MDCG  score  is  computed  as follows:
```latex
MDCG@k = 1/k \sum_{i=1}^k (2^(rel(i)-1)) / (log_2(i+1)).
```
The `rel(i)` relevance  function  is  applied  as  an indicator function that returns `1` if the i-th element is the expected item and `0` otherwise. Use `k=117`;
* **MAP**@k:  Indicates  the  proportion  of  the `k=5` recommended  items  that  are  in  the  same  category  as  the expected  item ([reference](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1390334.1390453)).  It  is  expected  that  this  metric  will give  an  insight  into  cases  where  the  recommended  item does  not  match  what  was  expected  but  the  item  is  still eligible, due to it being sufficiently similar.

[ImageNet challenge]:http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2014/
[Stanford CS231n]:https://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/

## Dataset
The Tiny ImageNet dataset has 100 classes. Each class has 1,000 training images, 100 validation images. The test set contains 10,000 images in total. We have released the training and validation sets with images and labels. The test set is released without labels. You are asked to predict the class label of each test image.

In detail, all training and validation images are from ImageNet training set. For test set, 5,000 images (id 0~4999) are selected from ImageNet validation set, while another 5,000 images (id 5000-9999) from [ImageNet-A]dataset, which called **Natural Adversarial Examples**. Modern deep CNNs achieve very low accuracy on these natural adversarial examples. ImageNet-A examples cause mistakes due to occlusion, weather, and other complications encountered in the long tail of scene configurations. You are recommended to read the [original paper] for more information.
[ImageNet-A]:https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07174.pdf
[original paper]:https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07174.pdf

For this course project, you need to consider how to achieve high classification accuracy on both general ImageNet images and natural adversarial examples.

## Submission
We use the test set accuracy to measure the performance. To submit your predictions on the test set, you need to upload a CSV file, which should be a two-column file with 10,001 lines (the first row is a header). Each line contains a pair of test image filename and its predicted class id (0-99). An example might look like:
```
Id,Category
0.jpg,0
1.jpg,1
2.jpg,2
...
9999.jpg,99
```
After the deadline, you are required to submit all codes and a short report (no less than one page). Plagiarism and labeling test images manually will be penalized.

## Grading Policy
Total marks for this project is 20:
- 14 marks based on rankings
   - 1st place: 14 marks
   - 2nd - last place: between 7 and 14 marks, in descending order
last place: 7 marks
- 6 marks based on the final report

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling technique to extract topic from the textual data.

While my starter notebook [Keywords Extraction Using TF-IDF Method](https://www.kaggle.com/rowhitswami/keywords-extraction-using-tf-idf-method) on NeuIPS Papers gives a head-start in Topic Modelling, but still there are some limitations of TF-IDF that LDA improves upon.

One of the major difference is that TF-IDF works at the word level. For example, if a document that is about **macOS** might be far from a document which is about **MacBook Air** when represented using TF-IDF. On the other hand, since **macOS** and **MacBook Air** frequently co-occur in articles they are likely to come from the same topic, so the LDA representation of these documents would be close.
LDA is a good option if you want to find the groups of related words, but you can't do it with TF-IDF.

## Expected Submission
You're required to implement topic modelling on all NeuIPS Papers, so the expected submission would be a **CSV** file with columns:
1. `source_id` -  Unique ID of the published paper
2. `keywords` - Extracted keywords from a paper

Additionally, you can also use LDA visualization tool [pyLDAvis](https://pypi.org/project/pyLDAvis/) to better understand the results.


## Evaluation
This is not a formal competition, so we won't measure the results strictly against a given validation set using a strict metric. Rather, what we'd like to see is a well-defined process to build a model that can deliver decent results (evaluated by yourself). Please note that the notebook should be well documented and contain any steps you're taking to prepare the data, including references to external data sources. A great entry will be informative, thought provoking, and fresh all at the same time.","","Topic Modelling of ML Papers using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)","Extract top keywords from NeuIPS Papers using LDA.","","44"

they might be tweets, articles, or network logs. Since our algorithms require numerical
inputs, we must find a way to convert such text into numerical features. To this end, we
utilize a sequence of techniques.
A token is a unit of text. For example, we may specify that our tokens are words, sentences,
or characters. A count vectorizer takes textual input and then outputs a vector consisting of
the counts of the textual tokens. A hashing vectorizer is a variation on the count vectorizer
that sets out to be faster and more scalable, at the cost of interpretability and hashing
collisions. Though it can be useful, just having the counts of the words appearing in a
document corpus can be misleading. The reason is that, often, unimportant words, such as
the and a (known as stop words) have a high frequency of occurrence, and hence little
informative content. For reasons such as this, we often give words different weights to
offset this. The main technique for doing so is tf-idf, which stands for Term-Frequency,
Inverse-Document-Frequency. The main idea is that we account for the number of times a
term occurs, but discount it by the number of documents it occurs in","","creating hashing vectorizer","","","0"

Researchers have access to large online archives of scientific articles. As a consequence, finding relevant articles has become more and more difficult. Tagging or topic modelling provides a way to give clear token of identification to research articles which facilitates recommendation and search process. 

Earlier on the Independence Day we conducted a Hackathon to predict the topics for each article included in the test set. Continuing with the same problem, In this Live Hackathon we will take one more step ahead and predict the tags associated with the articles.

Given the abstracts for a set of research articles, predict the tags for each article included in the test set. 
Note that a research article can possibly have multiple tags. The research article abstracts are sourced from the following 4 topics: 

1. Computer Science
2. Mathematics
3. Physics
4. Statistics

List of possible tags are as follows:

[Tags, Analysis of PDEs, Applications, Artificial Intelligence,Astrophysics of Galaxies, Computation and Language, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics, Data Structures and Algorithms, Differential Geometry, Earth and Planetary Astrophysics, Fluid Dynamics,Information Theory, Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics, Machine Learning, Materials Science, Methodology, Number Theory, Optimization and Control, Representation Theory, Robotics, Social and Information Networks, Statistics Theory, Strongly Correlated Electrons, Superconductivity, Systems and Control]

This notebook simplifies the steps to solve github bug predition through a typical workflow using BERT base uncased model. Before we get started with the workflow , the first question that comes into our mind is how do we get started. Well we will get there but let's first understand what exactly the problem statement is and what is expected here?


## Expected Submission

Detecting defects in software systems is an evergreen topic, since there is no real world software without bugs. There are many algorithms that has come up recently to help developers find bugs in software. The challenges of having curated datasets for own domain specific software , or code relates bug finding is rare. You can go through the research paper for gaining more ideas on Bug Prediction Databases and related algorithms that can be used.

Apart from the classical tasks that one can conduct on the Mini-DDSM data set  (i.e., disease classification/prediction, tumor/lesion localisation),  age  estimation from mammography is a new challenging venue. Age estimation  has  attracted  attention for its  various  medical  applications.  There  are  many  studies  on  human  age  estimation  from biomedical images. However, there is no research done on mammograms for age estimation, as far as we know (except our recent published work [1]). The purpose of this task is to devise a deep/machine learning model for estimating age from mammogram images.  In [1], we extracted deep learning features from the collected data set (Mini-DDSM), by which we built a model using Random Forests regressor to estimate the age automatically. The performance assessment was measured using the mean absolute error values. The average error value out of 10 tests on random selection of samples was +/- 8.11 years and r = 0.618, can you beat this base-line? I bet you can.

## Expected Submission
Since this is not a formal competition, and since it is based on voluntary work, I would just rely on calling upon your enthusiastic spirit to engage in this meaningful study. If you are up to this challenge, then you need to **construct an age prediction model** based on the following partitions: 70% training and 30% test (randomly selected). 

What we would like you to submit is the following:

**1) Your whole approach to building the model**
    1.1  Data preparation and pre-processing steps
    1.2 Detailed description of the model's architecture to ease replication

**2) Performance metrics**
    2.1 The average MAE (mean absolute error) value over 10 runs (samples  
          randomly selected based on 70% / 30% partitioning
    2.2 The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) value over 10 runs (samples randomly 
          selected based on 70% / 30% partitioning

## Evaluation
Average MAE and r (Pearson correlation coefficient)

The history of chess can be drawn back to around 1500 years, it was started in the North of India and spread throughout the world. Each player begins with 16 pieces one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops and eight pawns. Each type of piece moves uniquely of which the most powerful is the queen and the least powerful is the pawn. Although the rules of the game have been amended multiple times the main objective is to checkmate the opponent’s king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture. The invention of databases and chess engines in the 20th century revolutionized chess.
The goal of the project is to predict the number of moves (from 0-16) required to win for white with a king and a rook, given the position of white king, white rook and black king. It is a multiclass classification problem. The dataset has 28,056 rows and has the following attributes
1. White King file (column) - X1
2. White King rank (row) - X2
3. White Rook file -X3
4. White Rook rank -X4
5. Black King file - X5
6. Black King rank -X6
7. optimal depth-of-win for White in 0 to 16 moves, otherwise drawn {draw, zero, one, two, ..., sixteen}. -Y
As a team we are fascinated with the game. The rich history and the complexity (10 to the power 120 games possible) of the game dragged us to this project. The chess Engine came to limelight when deep blue, IBM Engine beat Garry Kasparov (in year 1997) the Russian Grand Master and world champion at that time. After that chess Engines took a huge turn and engines like stock fish were developed which is based on brute force algorithms. In late 2017 Google developed an AI based chess Engine which learned the game, in just 4 hours playing with itself and beat stockfish8.","","Aanalyzing checkmate pattern using King Rook King","","","0"

Every now and then we have an IPO of a company coming up. So, how should the investor decide whether to apply for an IPO or not with the **aim of earning a Listing gain**?

## Task details
Every now and then we have an IPO of a company coming up. So, how should the investor decide whether to apply for an IPO or not with the **aim of earning a Listing gain**?
There are a lot of parameters in the RHP (Red Herring Prospectus) which can help one decide this but is there any other pattern that can be looked into? 

The data provided in this task has a list of all the past IPOs of Indian companies. 
It has details like -  Issue Size (in crores) of the IPO, Subscription rate of QIB, HNI and RII categories, Issue price, link to the details of the company, etc. These columns can provide interesting insights and when used correctly can lead to the building of robust models for the task.

So, how should one decide if an IPO is worth applying or not, just by looking at the listing gain? It's pretty simple - If the listing gain is positive, then the IPO is worth applying, otherwise not. Thus it's a classification problem (Target variable? A derivative of the listing gain).

It is to be noted that the columns - Listing Open, Listing Close and Listing
Gains(%)  should not be used in the Classifier model. CMP and Current Gains (%)  should not be used either.


NOTE: We are not concerned about long term gains.

## Expected Submission
The solution can be a notebook containing a visualisation of important patterns in data. This can be further modified by adding a classifier model (1 for +ve listing gain positive and 0 for -ve listing gain).

## Evaluation

Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB) designed for evaluating the anomaly detection algorithms.

Currently the SKAB v0.9 is available, but soon v1.0 will be published (expected &gt;350 files with the anomalies).

We expect issues with the data (leaks and other problems) to be found.

## Expected Submission
Submit a notebook that implements the full lifecycle of data preparation, model creation and evaluation.

We expect participants to apply unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms. For the purposes of model fitting, either the fault-free dataset (located in a separate folder) or fault-free interval in the beginning of each dataset can be used.

## Evaluation
SKAB allows working with two main problems (outlier detection, changepoint detection). That's why we propose metrics for each problem:
- Outlier detection: False Alarm Rate (FAR), Missing Alarm Rate (MAR);
- Changepoint detection: Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) evaluation algorithm.

In the description and in [this readme](https://github.com/waico/SKAB) we propose the leaderboard for SKAB v0.9 both for outlier and changepoint detection problems.

"4001","1257909","2145476","04/08/2021 07:09:41","Spam filtering is a beginner’s example of document classification task which involves classifying an email as spam or non-spam (a.k.a. ham) mail. Spam box in your Gmail account is the best example of this. So lets get started in building a spam filter on a publicly available mail corpus.

We will walk through the following steps to build this application :

Preparing the text data.
Creating word dictionary.
Feature extraction process
Training the classifier

1. Preparing the text data.
 
The data-set used here, is split into a training set and a test set containing 702 mails and 260 mails respectively, divided equally between spam and ham mails. You will easily recognize spam mails as it contains *spmsg* in its filename.

In any text mining problem, text cleaning is the first step where we remove those words from the document which may not contribute to the information we want to extract. Emails may contain a lot of undesirable characters like punctuation marks, stop words, digits, etc which may not be helpful in detecting the spam email. The emails in Ling-spam corpus have been already preprocessed in the following ways:

a) Removal of stop words – Stop words like “and”, “the”, “of”, etc are very common in all English sentences and are not very meaningful in deciding spam or legitimate status, so these words have been removed from the emails.

b) Lemmatization – It is the process of grouping together the different inflected forms of a word so they can be analysed as a single item. For example, “include”, “includes,” and “included” would all be represented as “include”. The context of the sentence is also preserved in lemmatization as opposed to stemming (another buzz word in text mining which does not consider meaning of the sentence).

We still need to remove the non-words like punctuation marks or special characters from the mail documents. There are several ways to do it. Here, we will remove such words after creating a dictionary, which is a very convenient method to do so since when you have a dictionary, you need to remove every such word only once. So cheers !! As of now you don’t need to do anything.


Creating word dictionary.
 It can be seen that the first line of the mail is subject and the 3rd line contains the body of the email. We will only perform text analytics on the content to detect the spam mails. As a first step, we need to create a dictionary of words and their frequency. For this task, training set of 700 mails is utilized. This python function creates the dictionary for you.

3. Feature extraction process.
 
Once the dictionary is ready, we can extract word count vector (our feature here) of 3000 dimensions for each email of training set. Each word count vector contains the frequency of 3000 words in the training file. Of course you might have guessed by now that most of them will be zero. Let us take an example. Suppose we have 500 words in our dictionary. Each word count vector contains the frequency of 500 dictionary words in the training file. Suppose text in training file was “Get the work done, work done” then it will be encoded as [0,0,0,0,0,…….0,0,2,0,0,0,……,0,0,1,0,0,…0,0,1,0,0,……2,0,0,0,0,0]. Here, all the word counts are placed at 296th, 359th, 415th, 495th index of 500 length word count vector and the rest are zero.

4. Training the classifiers.
 
Here, I will be using scikit-learn ML library for training classifiers. It is an open source python ML library which comes bundled in 3rd party distribution anaconda or can be used by separate installation following this. Once installed, we only need to import it in our program.

I have trained two models here namely Naive Bayes classifier and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Naive Bayes classifier is a conventional and very popular method for document classification problem. It is a supervised probabilistic classifier based on Bayes theorem assuming independence between every pair of features. SVMs are supervised binary classifiers which are very effective when you have higher number of features. The goal of SVM is to separate some subset of training data from rest called the support vectors (boundary of separating hyper-plane). The decision function of SVM model that predicts the class of the test data is based on support vectors and makes use of a kernel trick.","","SMS Spam Detection","Spam Detection using NLTK","04/09/2021 23:59:00","1"

I. A large Indian retail chain has stores across 3 states in India: Maharashtra, Telangana and Kerala. These stores stock products across various categories such as FMCG (fast moving consumer goods), eatables / perishables and others. Managing the inventory is crucial for the revenue stream of the retail chain. Meeting the demand is important to not lose potential revenue, while at the same time stocking excessive products could lead to losses.
In this problem you are tasked with building a machine learning model to predict the sales of products across stores for one month. These models can then be used to power the recommendations for the inventory management software at these stores.

##II. The datasets are provided as cited below
Target attribute: ""sales"" (continuous)
traindata.csv: ● date : The date for which the observation was recorded ● productidentifier : The id for a product
● departmentidentifier : The id for a specific department in a store ● categoryof_product : The category to which a product belongs
● outlet : The id for a store
● state : The name of the state
● sales : The number of sales for the product

##Auxiliary Datasets:
● productprices.csv : The prices of products at each store for each week ● datetoweekidmap.csv : The mapping from a date to the weekid
● samplesubmission.csv :The format for submissions ● The testdata.csv file has all the attributes of the train_data.csv file excluding the sales (target) column
You are expected to create an analytical and forecasting framework to predict the sales of the products based on the quantitative and qualitative features provided in the datasets. You may derive new features from the existing features and also from the domain knowledge, which may help in improving the model efficiency

Data Set Information:
The data has been produced using Monte Carlo simulations. The first 21 features (columns 2-22) are kinematic properties measured by the particle detectors in the accelerator. The last seven features are functions of the first 21 features; these are high-level features derived by physicists to help discriminate between the two classes. There is an interest in using deep learning methods to obviate the need for physicists to manually develop such features. Benchmark results using Bayesian Decision Trees from a standard physics package and 5-layer neural networks are presented in the original paper. The last 500,000 examples are used as a test set.

Description
The dataset has been built from official ATLAS full-detector simulation, with ""Higgs to tautau"" events mixed with different backgrounds. The simulator has two parts. In the first, random proton-proton collisions are simulated based on the knowledge that we have accumulated on particle physics. It reproduces the random microscopic explosions resulting from the proton-proton collisions. In the second part, the resulting particles are tracked through a virtual model of the detector. The process yields simulated events with properties that mimic the statistical properties of the real events with additional information on what has happened during the collision, before particles are measured in the detector.
The signal sample contains events in which Higgs bosons (with a fixed mass of 125 GeV) were produced. The background sample was generated by other known processes that can produce events with at least one electron or muon and a hadronic tau, mimicking the signal. For the sake of simplicity, only three background processes were retained for the Challenge. The first comes from the decay of the Z boson (with a mass of 91.2 GeV) into two taus. This decay produces events with a topology very similar to that produced by the decay of a Higgs. The second set contains events with a pair of top quarks, which can have a lepton and a hadronic tau among their decay. The third set involves the decay of the W boson, where one electron or muon and a hadronic tau can appear simultaneously only through imperfections of the particle identification procedure.
Due to the complexity of the simulation process, each simulated event has a weight that is proportional to the conditional density divided by the instrumental density used by the simulator (an importance-sampling flavour), and normalised for integrated luminosity such that, in any region, the sum of the weights of events falling in the region is an unbiased estimate of the expected number of events falling in the same region during a given fixed time interval. In our case, the weights correspond to the quantity of real data taken during the year 2012. The weights are an artifact of the way the simulation works and so they are not part of the input to the classifier. For the Challenge, weights have been provided in the training set so the AMS can be properly evaluated. Weights were not provided in the qualifying set since the weight distribution of the signal and background sets are very different and so they would give away the label immediately. However, in the opendata.cern.ch dataset, weights and labels have been provided for the complete dataset.
The evaluation metric is the approximate median significance (AMS):
\[ \text{AMS} = \sqrt{2\left((s+b+b_r) \log \left(1 + \frac{s}{b + b_r}\right)-s\right)}\]
where
•	$s, b$: unnormalised true positive and false positive rates, respectively,
•	$b_r =10$ is the constant regularisation term,
•	$\log$ is the natural log.
More precisely, let $(y_1, \ldots, y_n) \in \{\text{b},\text{s}\}^n$ be the vector of true test labels, let $(\hat{y}_1, \ldots, \hat{y}_n) \in \{\text{b},\text{s}\}^n$ be the vector of predicted (submitted) test labels, and let $(w_1, \ldots, w_n) \in {\mathbb{R}^+}^n$ be the vector of weights. Then
\[ s = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i\mathbb{1}\{y_i = \text{s}\} \mathbb{1}\{\hat{y}_i = \text{s}\} \]
and
\[ b = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i\mathbb{1}\{y_i = \text{b}\} \mathbb{1}\{\hat{y}_i = \text{s}\}, \]
where the indicator function $\mathbb{1}\{A\}$ is 1 if its argument $A$ is true and 0 otherwise.

• Unzip the datasets and familiarize yourself with the data format.
• Split the datasets into a training set and a test set.
• Write a data preparation pipeline to convert each email into a feature vector.
Your preparation pipeline should transform an email into a (sparse) vector that
indicates the presence or absence of each possible word. For example, if all
emails only ever contain four words, “Hello,” “how,” “are,” “you,” then the email
“Hello you Hello Hello you” would be converted into a vector [1, 0, 0, 1]
(meaning [“Hello” is present, “how” is absent, “are” is absent, “you” is
present]), or [3, 0, 0, 2] if you prefer to count the number of occurrences of
each word.
You may want to add hyperparameters to your preparation pipeline to control
whether or not to strip off email headers, convert each email to lowercase,
remove punctuation, replace all URLs with “URL,” replace all numbers with
“NUMBER,” or even perform stemming (i.e., trim off word endings; there are
Python libraries available to do this).
Finally, try out several classifiers and see if you can build a great spam classifier,
with both high recall and high precision.","","To make an effective span classifier","","","0"

Hello guys! I would like to thank all who are interested in our dataset. I want to give you an example task to use this dataset efficiently. 

The first step of food and beverage quality assessment depends on the classification of the samples. Before classifying the food types, it is usually difficult to detect spoilage or diseases, since the same illnesses can cause different symptoms in diverse food types. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the food type before detecting the diseases or any early spoilage. 
 
In this task, you need to design an SVM classifier to compare 3 different approaches to see & decide if there is any benefit of the segmentation and feature extraction in these classification problems.   
1. Classify images without any segmentation and feature extraction via SVMs.
2. Classify segmented images without feature extraction via SVMs.
3. Classify segmented images by extracting features for your SVMs.  

You are free to choose the features you would like to use in this task.

## Evaluation
The best submission will be selected by checking the segmentation accuracy of your model, computational complexity, and classification accuracy of the system.

Most recent works in Economics, in particular Thomas Piketty's Capital In The 21st Century, argue that investment in education and specialization of workers yields more results to economic and social development than the so-called free-market and foreign investments intake in emerging countries. Can we extract some insights from this datasets that back up this argument? Even better, what ideas can we take from this dataset that increment in the discussion of better social settings in emerging economies?

## Expected Submission
Users can submit any analysis they contribute to. It's expected to address at least the relations between government expenditure on education and economic development (or social development). Users are free to increment their analysis with whatever information they find relevant.

## Evaluation
Users can contribute to each other by evaluating other's works, by including the usage of following criteria (but not limited to them):

A good benchmark metrics is the key to success for solving a machine learning task. The metric should reflect every aspect of the task objective. For instance, PR-AUC is a good metric for binary classification tasks since it covers both the precision and recall properties of a good classifier. 

Unfortunately, current popular benchmark metrics for image generative modeling are less than ideal. The inherent difficulty of evaluating the similarity between the generated distribution and unknown training distribution (with only finite training samples as proxy) poses a great challenge to metric design. To make matters worse, there have been no good method to fairly benchmark a metric so comparison between metrics are currently not possible.

In this dataset, users can benchmark a newly designed metric with the large amount of image instances sampled from diverse generative models plus human image quality annotations. Furthermore, the labels for intentional memorization technique can serve as a sanity check for whether the metric rewards training sample memorization.

## Expected Submission
Users should submit a notebook with a novel generative modeling metric and evaluate the generated instance provided in this dataset on the metric.

## Evaluation
A good generative modeling metric should produce metric scores that are at least
1. aligned with human perception
2. sensitive to training sample memorization (either ignore or penalize memorized instances)
Other properties such as distribution diversity (mode collapse detection) and evaluation efficiency are also ideal but may require external resources beyond the scope of this dataset to verify.","","Benchmarking Image Generative Modeling Metrics","A large-scale benchmark to evaluate novel image generative modeling metrics.","","0"

The outbreak of Covid-19 is developing into a major international crisis, and it's starting to influence important aspects of daily life. For example:

Travel: Bans have been placed on hotspot countries, corporate travel has been reduced, and flight fares have dropped.
Supply chains: International manufacturing operations have often had to throttle back production and many goods solely produced in China have been halted altogether.
Grocery stores: In highly affected areas, people are starting to stock up on essential goods.
A strong model that predicts how the vaccines help in recovering from COVID-19 once it came in market. What's the trend of new cases and existing cases.

## Expected Submission
Submit a notebook that implements the full lifecycle of data preparation, model creation and evaluation. Feel free to use this dataset plus any other data you have available. Since this is not a formal competition, you're not submitting a single submission file, but rather your whole approach to building a model.

The notebook should be well documented and contain:

Any steps you're taking to prepare the data, including references to external data sources
Training of your model
The table mentioned above
An evaluation of your table against the real data. Let's keep it simple and measure Mean Absolute Error.

## Evaluation
This is not a formal competition, so we won't measure the results strictly against a given validation set using a strict metric. Rather, what we'd like to see is a well-defined process to build a model that can deliver decent results (evaluated by yourself).

At the end of March, we'll look at the top 5 upvoted submissions and holistically award the best solution. We’ll announce and recognize March’s Kaggle Tasks Award Winner on our Twitter account at the beginning of April, sharing an official certificate of accomplishment.

Our team will be looking at:

Accuracy - How well does the model perform on the real data? Can it be generalized over time? Can it be applied to other scenarios? Was it overfit?
Data Preparation - How well was the data analyzed prior to feeding it into the model? Are there any useful visualizations? Does the reader learn any new techniques through this submission? A great entry will be informative, thought-provoking, and fresh all at the same time.
Documentation - Are your code and notebook, and additional data sources well documented so a reader can understand what you did? Are your sources clearly cited? A high-quality analysis should be concise and clear at each step so the rationale is easy to follow and the process is reproducible.
This task is not strictly about getting the best submission score. Since it involves data that changes in real-time, the most accurate solution would only require uploading the real historic data on the last day of March, but that’s beside the spirit of this Task. We’re looking for genuine approaches to building models on a real problem that can serve as learning examples for our community","","Vaccinations availability","","","0"

Pancreatic cancer is rarely caught early. Could a simple urine test change that? Your task is to use this dataset to correctly identify patients with pancreatic cancer (`diagnosis` = 3).  Your **only** predictor variables should be `age`, `sex`, `creatinine`, `LYVE1`, `REG1B`, and `TFF1`. 

## Validation  

You will need to use cross-validation or a train/test split to evaluate how well your predictive model performs on new data. The original authors used a 50/50 train/test split, with a pre-specified analysis plan (their exact splits are not part of the dataset, though). 

## Expected Submission

You should submit a notebook showing how you developed your model. Clinical predictive models are most useful if they are interpretable—the original authors of this dataset chose simple logistic regression, thanks to its easy-to-interpret coefficients. However, a less-interpretable model might be justifiable, if it performs better!  

## Evaluation

Pancreatic cancer is rare, so beyond the typical AUC - ROC, metrics like sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) are also of interest. The original paper was able to achieve an AUC of 0.936 on the validation set—can you beat this result?

Developers use Bugout.dev to save knowledge from wherever they work. One place that developers do a lot of work is in their editors/IDEs.

Bugout stores knowledge in Markdown files, and our users frequently want to store code from their editors in highlighted code blocks.

Applying the right highlighting requires us to understand which programming language a snippet was written in in the first place. We currently use file extensions to determine this.

We are curious how well machine learning models can do on the same tasks, which is why we have created this dataset.

## Expected Submission
A notebook containing:
1. Training - evaluation split of the whole data
2. Model which trains over the training partition
3. Summary of performance on model over the evaluation partition

If this dataset is too large when you're developing your model, you can start on the development version that we created: [GitHub Code Snippets - Development sample](https://www.kaggle.com/simiotic/github-code-snippets-development-sample).

Business Use Case
There has been a revenue decline for a Portuguese bank and they would like to know what actions to take. After investigation, they found out that the root cause is that their clients are not depositing as frequently as before. Knowing that term deposits allow banks to hold onto a deposit for a specific amount of time, so banks can invest in higher gain financial products to make a profit. In addition, banks also hold a better chance to persuade term deposit clients into buying other products such as funds or insurance to further increase their revenues. As a result, the Portuguese bank would like to identify existing clients that have a higher chance to subscribe for a term deposit and focus marketing efforts on such clients.

Hi, Recently I have encountered an interesting project from a startup windmill company. The core of the project is the application of a secondary braking system that is purely based on predictive analytics. We have stumbled upon a situation when we are asked to predict the possibility of an increase/decrease in speed of rotation at a given time. We know that it gets affected by external factors like wind speed, wind direction, and rotor size, etc. But they're willing to find it only through the speed variation data because the primary braking system senses environmental conditions and applies to the brake to make the blades rotate in a controlled/safe optimized range. I personally believe with their R&D department that we don't need external sensors to get more environmental data because there is a chance that the speed variation data alone have innate required features to predict the decrease or increase in speed in that controlled range.

Data Description:
*Industry Safety range 40m/s to 60m/s
*The safety range is handled by a primary braking system that maintains the speed at optimal 50-55m/s.
*Data given is the normalized speed variation in this primary optimal range at a time interval of 10 minutes.

Help me whether the speed variation is predictable or not? or can we predict drastic changes with an optimized model?

While the previous FridayDataSetTask episodes were about ""identification"", this one is actually a step within a project, and focused on ""association"", i.e. using the link within the dataset to ""seed"" a NLP mini-project.

In this case, I am actually sharing the concept, but already did both this step and some of the ensuing NLP steps.

So, each FridayDataSetTask episode in this ""string"" will actually share some steps and some concepts.

The concept? Whenever preparing a workshop for a brainstorming, it happens often to have to collect contributions, and then prepare a synopsis to share with all the participants, checking after the discussions if all the contributions have been considered.

Doing that manually is extenuating- also when you have few thousand pages less than those covered by this set of documents.

This first step is apparently simple (retrieve documents using the link within the dataset), but, as there are hundreds of documents for thousands of pages across a dozen of sessions:
1. retrieving and storing documents is the simplest part of the task
2. before writing a single line of code, you should explore the documents and dataset
3. after exploring, you should first define a ""storing and classification approach"" that makes possible to access information
4. access to information should be both to documents as they are, and to their content
5. this all should enable also cross-document analysis.

Obviously, as stated above, I already did all the steps in this task.

But, before sharing later on this year my own ""solution"", I would like to share the approach and see if others can come with other solutions.

As I wrote above: this approach on this documentation is actually derived from prior experience on other similar yet different activities that involved collecting documents- be it to define a new initiative, define a budget, change the organizational structure (and culture) or a company, design a new (software and service) product, carry out vendor evaluations and audit, or presenting/discussing a roadmap or the results of an initiative.

For more details on the documentation and the context of this dataset, please visit its documentation.

## Expected Submission

I plan to release some material by June 2021, and then identify if I should create other datasets, or implement the current dataset (as an example, I store locally also the press releases, but are not shown on the online database)

Anyway- if you post Notebooks suggesting other areas of development, I will see to include / amend further requirements, KPIs, etc

## Evaluation

I am interested (and working on) what can be repeatable, not linked to a single, specific event (albeit once in a while I use the database also to support my publications focused on specific events or ideas)

Continuing on the PNRR series started with the previous [FridayDataSetTask04 : PNRR proposals - society and politics - part 1](http://robertolofaro.com/DataSetTask_20210423), this is another step within the same project, and focused on ""extracting information"", i.e. extracting and storing contents from hundreds of Acrobat documents linked within the dataset this task is attached to.

Each FridayDataSetTask episode in this ""string"" will actually share some steps and some concepts.

In this case, the key issue is simple: each Acrobat was produced by a different source using different software packages and following their own design guidelines.

The sources ranged from text files that had been converted into Acrobat files, to the usual Microsoft Office or GoogleDoc, to more exoteric applications (some resulted in Acrobat files that are anything but seen as ""standard"").

This task is therefore simple: find a Python library (or set of libraries) that can extract the text from the Acrobat files, and [store it in a way that is consistent with the ""storing and classification approach"" that you identified in the previous task](http://robertolofaro.com/DataSetTask_20210423).

Obviously, as stated above, I already did all the steps in this task.

While the previous task was on text visualization, this one is on data visualization using maps (and geopandas).

This dataset was created as a support for future publications (and webapps) based on data.

Since the 1980s, when I designed and delivered my first Decision Support System model, one of the first requests from the business side was to be able to interact with data.

And, as my first models were for senior management and other ""systemic view"" (e.g. financial/operations controller) managers, more often than not this meant: territories.

In this case, could be political territories, i.e. countries, as represented within this sample conversion, containing the map of Italy (as a conversion using open source tools from SHP files into CSV).

This dataset is part of a series that contains three other datasets:

* [UN SDG - EU 27 sample datamart (subset for 7 KPIs)](https://www.kaggle.com/robertolofaro/sdgeu-datamart-sample)
* [Selected Indicators from World Bank 2000-2019: 33 indicators from World Bank website for a data project](https://www.kaggle.com/robertolofaro/selected-indicators-from-world-bank-20002019)
* [EU 27 Energy sources - consumption 1990-2018 / energy production, import, export by source - consumption by sector](https://www.kaggle.com/robertolofaro/eu-27-energy-sources-consumption-19902018)

While you can extract other maps from the sources (see the description of the dataset for the links), you could also ""go creative"" on the concept of ""territory"" and ""patterns"".

Example: creating new maps based on specific patterns within the KPIs, a kind of [Gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering) that could identify territories where, e.g. specific initiatives could have more chances of success than others.

Tailoring public incentives and business initiatives based on data is still a matter of art- not because we lack the means, but we lack motivation.

In both cases, political choices are involved- hence, a purely data-based approach might be useful to identify patterns, but not to make choices.

## Expected Submission

This is the last FridayDataSetTask of this series- more will follow in the future.

Until the beginning of the next series, I plan to release, and then identify if I should create other datasets, or implement the current dataset (as an example, I store locally also the press releases, but are not shown on the online database)

Anyway- if you post Notebooks suggesting other areas of development, I will see to include / amend further requirements, KPIs, etc

## Evaluation

I am interested (and working on) what can be repeatable, not linked to a single, specific event (albeit once in a while I use the database also to support my publications focused on specific events or ideas)

The small bowel constitutes the gastrointestinal (GI) tract’s mid-part, situated between the stomach and the large bowel. It is three to four meters long and has a surface of about 30 m^2, including the surface of the villi, and plays a crucial role in absorbing nutrients. Therefore, disorders in the small bowel may cause severe growth retardation in children and nutrient deﬁciencies in children and adults. This organ may be affected by chronic diseases, like Crohn’s disease, coeliac disease, and angiectasis,or malignant diseases like lymphoma and adenocarcinoma. These diseases may represent a substantial health challenge for both patients and society, and a thorough examination of the lumen is frequently necessary to diagnose and treat them. However, the small bowel, due to its anatomical location, is less accessible for inspection by ﬂexible endoscopes commonly used for the upper GI tract and the large bowel. Since early 2000, video capsule endoscopy (VCE) has been used, usually as a complementary test for patients with GI bleeding. A VCE consists of a small capsule containing a wide-angle camera, lightsources, batteries, and other electronics. The patient swallows the capsule, which then captures a video as it moves passively through the GI tract. A recorder, carried by the patient or included in the capsule, stores the video before a medical expert assesses it after the procedure. [Source of information: Reasearch paper: Kvasir-Capsule, a video capsule endoscopy dataset]

Artificial intelligence (AI) is predicted to have profound effects on the future of video capsule endoscopy (VCE) technology.The potential lies in improving anomaly detection while reducing manual labour. However, medical data is often sparse and unavailable to the research community, and qualified medical personnel rarely have time for the tedious labelling work.

## Expected Submission
You are required to build a machine learning model to recognize the disease label of the respective images.

This task aims to detect speech activity in a mixed audio signal, containing speech, noise
and silence. The basic idea is to discriminate speech and other types of sounds (noise, silence, music, etc) by measuring audio signal parameters, such as short-time ZCR (zero-crossing rate), short-time amplitude, F0, etc. The first method consists in choosing some threshold values for such parameters, whereas the second methods consists in using neural networks to classify frames into speech/non-speech, using the speech parameters as input features. The final system should be able to display an audio signal and tag each frame as speech/non-speech.

Cada año se realiza un examen Teorico para la admision a las residencias medicas, se tiene la creencia popular que este examen esta corrompido, existen mitos de que el examen es vendido.
El objetivo de este Reto (Task) es obtener pruebas no paramtericas que permitan demostrar la hipotesis de que este examen efectivamente cuenta con un grupo de personas que han adquirido el examen antes de la evauluacion. 

## Resultados Esperados
De ser cierto lo anterior , entonces se espera qencontrar dos grupos de personas: 
1.- Las facultades que no Hicieron trampa, formaran parte de una distribucion normal.
2.- Las facultades que hiceron trampa formaran parte de otra distribucion normal, con una media y distribucion normal diferente a la anterior.

##Evaluacion
La solucion debera contener el listado de las facultades que probablemente han hecho trampa, mediante al analisis de atipicos.

Es decir si una facultad en la mayoria de los años de evaluacion se encontraba en un ranking inferior y en algun año se encontraba en un ranking superior, esto podria resultar como una anomalia.

## Details

Every year a Theoretical exam is carried out for admission to medical residences, there is a popular belief that this exam is corrupted, there are myths that the exam is sold.
The objective of this Challenge (Task) is to obtain non-parametric tests that allow to demonstrate the hypothesis that this test actually has a group of people who have acquired the test before the evaluation.

## Expected results
If the above is true, then you are expected to find two groups of people:
1.- Faculties that did not Cheat will be part of a normal distribution.
2.- The faculties that cheated will be part of another normal distribution, with a mean and normal distribution different from the previous one.

##Evaluation
The solution should contain a list of the faculties that have probably cheated, by means of the atypical analysis.

In other words, if a faculty in most of the evaluation years was in a lower ranking and in some year it was in a higher ranking, this could result as an anomaly.","","Detection of Atypical, how index of corruption","Deteccion de atipicos como indice de corrupcion","","1"

For years we tried to create a model able to predict blood lactate concentration [La] during exercise. We did not succeeded. Our attempts have been summarised in a recent (review on the topic)[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11332-019-00557-x]. Info about oxygen consumption (VO2) prediction  during exercise are also give in the review, but predicting cycling VO2 seems to be easier (see this regression model (here)[https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/comments?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0229466]). 

## Expected Submission
A model that can take as input easy-to-obtain inputs should be prioritised. Power and cadence and respiratory frequency as well as heart rate all constitute easy-to-collect input. Oxygen consumption requires a metabolic cart. 

## Evaluation
Goodness of the solution will be evaluated based on the accuracy of the predictions in [La] for an entire exercise not used to train the model (i.e. to calibrate the parameters of the model).","","Predicting blood lactate during cycling exercise","","","0"

Patient 0, in order to become infected, must have recently traveled outside of the United States. We also know that excessive screen time ( &gt; 20 hours a week) and unhealthy eating and sleeping habits makes initial contraction more likely. Patient 0 has likely taken some college courses, although taking a CS course (along with its many other benefits) makes contraction less likely.

### Symptoms:
In the Zombolavirus infection process, symptoms progress from
cold/cough/fever 
→ eating raw meat/biting/coughing blood
→ zombie

Beware: although the above statements are assumptions, real life is messy, and Patient 0 may not possess all of these attributes.

## Concluding Questions
Once you have identified Patient 0, please answer the questions below.

What is/are the name(s) of the potential Patient 0? It is okay to have more than 1 possible patient 0.
What is the name of the most likely Patient 0. From the list of above patients, choose the patient most likely to be patient 0. Use this candidate to answer the remaining questions.
Does P0 have more than 20 hrs screentime?			
Has P0 left the country lately?			
Does P0 sleep less than 8 hours a night?				
Does P0 eat healthy foods?			
What is P0's medical history? Has any prior illnesses?			
Where does P0 live?			
Is P0 old? (Over 60)			
Is P0 young? (Under 20)			
What are P0's earliest symptoms?		
What are P0’s current symptoms?	
Has P0 gone to college?			
Has P0 taken CS courses?	
What traits of P0 do not seem to fit the profile(e.g. Screentime, educational background, age)?
Overall, why did you decide on the identity of P0? What seems to make them P0 (food? screen time?)	
		
## Bonus Questions
These questions should be answered if students have extra time.

Some patients at first showed symptoms of Zombolavirus, but seemed to get better by Day 14 (with only mild symptoms, such as colds). What factor(s) did these recovered patients have in common?
How many patients are less than 5 years old?
How many patients are at least 80 years old?
Of those who turned into zombies, what percent have traveled internationally recently?

## End of Event Discussion
Each group that completes the challenge should choose their P0, and explain to the class the factors that led to their decision. If different groups have different P0’s, the class should vote after each group has presented. Once a consensus has been reached, the teacher should submit the class decision online.

Several students took their puppies for a walk in a dog park, got distracted, and lost their puppies! Now, they are asking you for help in finding their lost puppies. We can see 200 dogs in the dog park, and we need to find the lost puppies.
Each puppy has a microchip that contains their puppy ID. For each missing puppy, determine that puppy’s ID.

## All the Puppies We Need to Recover
Find the ID’s for each of these puppies.

Luna
     Gray fur, wearing a collar, small and short (less than 20 inches tall), and very           
     friendly. Luna’s owner, Abby, is so upset that she can’t remember whether Luna           
     has a short tail or a long tail, although she thinks that Luna probably has a long 
     tail.
Halo
     Trained, golden fur, slobbery, wearing a collar, lightweight
Geode
     Spotted fur, slobbery, mean attitude, mixed breed, more than 45 inches tall
Charlie
     Black fur, not wearing a collar, less than 10 inches tall
Frosty
     Large and heavy purebred puppy, who is very shy. Has a short tail but does not      have sharp teeth. 
Shadow
     Trained, medium sized puppy who is very lightweight. Mixed breed, wearing a collar, has sharp teeth, but is very playful.

Students must answer extra questions about Luna. For the other 5 puppies, however, students will only need to determine the puppies' ID.

## Known Facts
You have a list of the 200 dogs in the dog park. Try to filter the rows of your spreadsheet until you have found the ID’s of each puppy!

Once you have found Luna in particular, please answer the following questions. You, as a veterinarian in training, have also been asked to answer a few questions about Luna’s health, development, and personality.

For the rest of the puppies, simply find their ID.

The task is to distinguish good items from anomalous items. This can be defined as a binary classification problem and as such solved with supervised learning techniques. However, classes can be highly imbalanced.

Imagine an industrial manufacturing processes, where millions of parts are produced every day, but 1 percent of the production may be defective. A supervised learning approach would clearly suffer from this imbalance. Auto-encoders however are perfect for this situation, because they can be trained on normal parts and don't require annotated data. Once trained, we can give it a feature representation for a part and compare autoencoder output with input. The larger the difference, the more likely the input contains an anomaly.

Auto-encoders consist of two parts: an encoder that encodes the input data using a reduced representation and a decoder that attempts to reconstruct the original input data from the reduced representation. The network is subject to constraints that force the auto-encoder to learn a compressed representation of the training set. It does this in an unsupervised manner and is therefore most suitable for problems related to anomaly detection.","","Detect Anomalies in Images","","","1"

The sub-regions considered for evaluation are: 1) the ""enhancing tumor"" (ET), 2) the ""tumor core"" (TC), and 3) the ""whole tumor"" (WT) [see figure below]. The ET is described by areas that show hyper-intensity in T1Gd when compared to T1, but also when compared to “healthy” white matter in T1Gd. The TC describes the bulk of the tumor, which is what is typically resected. The TC entails the ET, as well as the necrotic (fluid-filled) and the non-enhancing (solid) parts of the tumor. The appearance of the necrotic (NCR) and the non-enhancing (NET) tumor core is typically hypo-intense in T1-Gd when compared to T1. The WT describes the complete extent of the disease, as it entails the TC and the peritumoral edema (ED), which is typically depicted by hyper-intense signal in FLAIR.

The provided segmentation labels have values of 1 for NCR & NET, 2 for ED, 4 for ET, and 0 for everything else.

This new task focuses on exploring uncertainty measures in the context of glioma region segmentation, with the objective of rewarding participating methods with resulting predictions that are: (a) confident when correct and (b) uncertain when incorrect. Participants willing to participate in this new task are asked to upload (in addition to their segmentation results of Task 1) 3 generated uncertainty maps associated with the resulting labels at every voxel.

The uncertainty maps should be associated with 1) ""enhancing tumor"" (ET), 2) ""tumor core"" (TC), and 3) ""whole tumor"" (WT) regions. In this manner, the uncertainties will be associated with the traditional BraTS Dice metrics. The participants should normalize their uncertainty values between 0 - 100 across the entire dataset, such that ""0"" represents the most certain prediction and ""100"" represents the most uncertain. Note that, in any one single patient case, the values of the uncertainties do not need to take on the full range from [0 100] (i.e. The algorithm may be confident for predictions at all voxels for a single patient). To keep storage requirements to a minimum, participants are expected to submit uncertainties in ‘uint8’ type.

The participants are called to upload 4 nifti (.nii.gz) volumes (3 uncertainty maps and 1 multi-class segmentation volume from Task 1) onto CBICA's Image Processing Portal format. For example, for each ID in the dataset, participants are expected to upload following 4 volumes:

The ‘positions file’ allows for omitting the work with calibration files and focusing for instance on
classification, while making use of the fact that the cameras are static. It consists of information
about where exactly a given set of particular volumes of space project to in all of the views. The
height of each volume space corresponds to the one of an average person’s height.
We discretize the ground surface as a regular grid. The 3D space occupied if a person is standing at
a particular position is modelled by a cylinder positioned centrally on the grid point. Each cylinder
projects into each of the separate 2D views as a rectangle whose position in the view is given in
pixel coordinates.
Using a 480x1440 grid – totalling into 691200 positions – and the provided camera calibration files,
we yield such file which is available for download. Each position is assigned an ID using 0-based
enumeration ([0, 691199]). The views’ ordering numbers in this file also follow such enumeration,
i.e. they range between 0 and 6 inclusively. The positions which are not visible in a given view are
assigned coordinates of -1.
Annotations
Full ground truth annotations are provided for 400 frames using a frame rate of 2fps. On average,
there are 20 persons on each frame. Thus, our dataset provides approximately 400x20x7=56,000
single-view bounding boxes. By interpolating, the annotations’ size can be further increased. This
annotations were generated through workers hired on Amazon Mechanical Turk.
Note that the annotations roughly correspond to the coordinates of the above-elaborated position
file and thus include the ID of the annotated position which is estimated to be occupied by the
specific target. These position IDs are in accordance with the provided positions file.","","Perform Multi-Camera Detection","","","0"

"4810","1407827","5547273","06/17/2021 13:33:39","There are 3 steps to complete this task -

In the first step, the annotators mark the tweet as being offensive or not offensive.
If the tweet is offensive then the annotators need to tell if the offense is targeted towards somebody or something or it is not targeted.
If the offense is targeted then the annotators also need to tell who it is targeted against.

Rules & Tips
Please rate the tweet according to whether it is offensive generally or to the target, not whether you are personally offended by it.

Sub-task A: Offensive or not

In this sub-task we are interested in the identification of offensive posts and posts containing any form of (untargeted) profanity. In this sub-task there are 2 categories in which the tweet could be classified -

Not Offensive - This post does not contain offense or profanity.  Non-offensive posts do not include any form of offense or profanity.
Offensive - This post contains offensive language or a targeted (veiled or direct) offense.  In our annotation, we label a post as offensive if it  contains any form of non-acceptable language (profanity) or a targeted offense which can be veiled or direct. To sum up this category includes insults, threats, and posts containing profane language and swear words.
Sub-task B: Offense types

In this sub-task we are interested in categorizing offenses. Only posts containing offenses are included in sub-task B. In this sub-task, annotators need to label from one of the following categories -

Targeted Insult - A post containing an insult or a threat to an individual, group, or others;
Untargeted - A post containing non-targeted profanity and swearing. 
Posts containing general profanity are not targeted but they contain non-acceptable language. On the other hand, insults and threats are targeted at an individual or group.

Sub-task C: Offense target

Finally, in sub-task C we are interested in the target of offenses. Only posts which are either insults or threats are included in this sub-task. The three categories included in sub-task C are the following:

Individual - The target of the offensive post is an individual: a famous person, named individual or an unnamed person interacting in the conversation.
Group - The target of the offensive post is a group of people considered as a unity due to the same ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation, political affiliation, religious belief, or something else.
Other – The target of the offensive post does not belong to any of the previous two categories (e.g. an organization, a situation, an event, or an issue).

All possible label combinations across all the sub-tasks are as below:

Not offensive
Offensive, Untargeted
Offensive, Targeted Insult, (Individual | Group | Other)

2) Examples

Sub-task A: Offensive language identification

Some of the examples include:

@thecomeback @JABItalia Fuck @APrecourt - Offensive
Hey @LIRR , you are disgusting. Offensive
A true American literary icon. #PhilipRoth will be missed. - Not offensive

Sub-task B: Automatic categorization of offense types

Some of the examples include:

Your Client ComZ is an ecommerce company. The company wants to focus on targeting the right customers  with the right products to increase overall revenue and conversion rate.

To target the right customers with the right products, they need to build an ML model for marketing based on user interaction with products in the past like number of views,  most viewed product, number of activities of user, vintage of user and others. 

ComZ has contacted the Data Science and Engineering team to use this information to fuel the personalized advertisements, email marketing campaigns, or special offers on the landing and category pages of the company's website.

You, being a part of the data engineering team, are expected to “Develop input features”  for the efficient marketing model given the Visitor log data and User Data.

1. Visitor Log Data – It is a browsing log data of all the visitors and the users. This table contains the following information:

WebClientID
Unique ID of browser for every system. (If a visitor is using multiple browsers on a system like Chrome, Safari, then there would be a different web clientid for each browser). The ID remains consistent unless the user clears their cookie.

VisitDateTime
Date and time of visit. There are two different formats for DateTime. 

One is in datetime format “2018-05-07 04:28:45.970”
Another one is in unix datetime format “1527051855673000000”
ProductID
Unique ID of product browsed/ clicked by the visitor

UserID      
Unique ID of the registered user. As expected, this is available for registered users only, not for all visitors. 

Activity
Type of activity can be browsing (pageload) or clicking a product

Browser
Browser used by the visitor

OS
Operating System of the system used by the visitor

City
City of the visitor

Country
Country of the visitor



2. User Data – It has registered user information like signup date and segment.

UserID
Unique ID of the registered user.

Signup Date
Date of registration for the user

User Segment
User Segment (A/B/C) created based on historical engagement

Now based on the above two tables, you need to create an input feature set for the Marketing Model.



3. Input Feature table:

UserID
Unique ID of the registered user

No_of_days_Visited_7_Days
How many days a user was active on platform in the last 7 days.

No_Of_Products_Viewed_15_Days
Number of Products viewed by the user in the last 15 days

User_Vintage
Vintage (In Days) of the user as of today

Most_Viewed_product_15_Days
Most frequently viewed (page loads) product by the user in the last 15 days. If there are multiple products that have a similar number of page loads then , consider the recent one. If a user has not viewed any product in the last 15 days then put it as Product101. 

Most_Active_OS
Most Frequently used OS by user. 

Recently_Viewed_Product
Most recently viewed (page loads) product by the user.

If a user has not viewed any product then put it as Product101.

Pageloads_last_7_days
Count of Page loads in the last 7 days by the user

Clicks_last_7_days
Count of Clicks in the last 7 days  by the user



Process to create Input Feature:

When ComZ does a targeting campaign, It follows the below process. 



In the current case, you are supposed to generate an input feature set as on 28-May-2018. So, the visitor table is from 07-May-2018 to 27-May-2018.

As a Data Engineer Creating ETL Pipeline would definitely be appreciated and provide you the added advantage in interviews, Your effort should be to build ETL Pipeline such that passing the information of user data and log data, It can generate the input feature table automatically

Things you should take into consideration:

You are supposed to smartly clean and pre-process data like 

Imputing missing values effectively
Handle different format of date time features
Values stored in different case for the text information


Evaluation Metric:

For continuous features, we will first calculate Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for each continuous feature.
MAPE = Absolute Value (Derived Value - Actual Value)/ Actual Value

Then, we will calculate accuracy of Derived Value which is Mean Performance (MP) 

MP = (1 - MAPE)

For categorical features, we will calculate Accuracy for each categorical feature.
Accuracy = Percentage of value same in both derived feature and actual feature.
Finally, we will take the weighted sum of MP and Accuracy for all features.
Score = 1/8 ( MP(No_of_days_Visited_7_Days)  + MP(No_Of_Products_Viewed_15_Days) + MP(User_Vintage)+    Accuracy(Most_Viewed_product_15_Days) + Accuracy(Most_Active_OS) + Accuracy(Recently_Viewed_Product) + MP(Pageloads_last_7_days) + MP(Clicks_last_7_days))

Please note that scoring is going to be done using an automated script and difference in between the field names or order from the submission file format may result in zero scoring/error message due to the failure of the scoring script.
Participants may do multiple submissions. They would have to select on the platform which one to be treated as the final submission. If not selected, the submission with the highest score would be considered as final.
Only 5 submissions per day are allowed
Final winners would be announced only after the submitted code reviews and the analysis of the rest of the document submissions made by the participants.
Quality of code would be judged on the following parameters – functionality, reusability, modularity, documentation, testing and validation.
Should be scalable to be executed on 10 GB data as well.","","Target the right Customer","","","0"

You are passionate about data & animals and are looking for a way to make meaningful impact. To do that, you'll explore and analyze an animal shelter's data and give them **1-3 actionable insights**.

## Expected Submission

Submit a well documented notebook with these two sections:

### Section 01: Exploratory Data Analysis

Explore the data and answer the below questions using both markdown write-ups & visualizations:

- Are there any null values or outliers? How will you wrangle/handle them?
- Are there any useful variables that you can engineer with the given data?
- Are there any relationships between the variables? Can you prove any of these relationships with statistical tests?

Please don't feel limited to these questions. Explore the data as you please! The most important thing is to be like Sherlock Holmes and look in between the lines (data) to find something that isn't apparent!

### Section 02: Actionable Insights

Provide 1 to 3 actionable insights that are supported by your EDA. Please make sure that each insight is accompanied by a visualization. 

Some guiding questions:

- Which locations are booming with stray animals? Can we manage a stray neutering campaign in that area?
- Are we frequently intaking strays that are sick? Is there a hidden pattern for those strays?
- Which animals receive positive outcomes types? Can we capitalize on that?


## Evaluation

This is not a formal competition, so results won't be measured using a strict metric. Rather, what one would like to see is a well-defined process of exploratory  with well supported and visualized actionable insights

You're a marketing analyst and you've been told by the Chief Marketing Officer that recent marketing campaigns have not been as effective as they were expected to be. You need to analyze the data set to understand this problem and propose data-driven solutions.

## Expected Submission

Submit a well documented notebook with these **four sections**:

### Section 01: Exploratory Data Analysis

- Are there any null values or outliers? How will you wrangle/handle them?
- Are there any variables that warrant transformations?
- Are there any useful variables that you can engineer with the given data?
- Do you notice any patterns or anomalies in the data? Can you plot them?

### Section 02: Statistical Analysis

Please run statistical tests in the form of regressions to answer these questions & propose data-driven action recommendations to your CMO. *Make sure to interpret your results with non-statistical jargon so your CMO can understand your findings.*

- What factors are significantly related to the number of store purchases?
- Does US fare significantly better than the Rest of the World in terms of total purchases?
- Your supervisor insists that people who buy gold are more conservative. Therefore, people who spent *an above average amount* on gold in the last 2 years would have more in store purchases. Justify or refute this statement using an appropriate statistical test
- Fish has Omega 3 fatty acids which are good for the brain. Accordingly, do ""Married PhD candidates"" have a significant relation with amount spent on fish? What other factors are significantly related to amount spent on fish? *(Hint: use your knowledge of interaction variables/effects)*
- Is there a significant relationship between geographical regional and success of a campaign?

### Section 03: Data Visualization

Please plot and visualize the answers to the below questions.

- Which marketing campaign is most successful?
- What does the average customer look like for this company?
- Which products are performing best?
- Which channels are underperforming?

### Section 04: CMO Recommendations

Bring together everything from Sections 01 to 03 and provide data-driven recommendations/suggestions to your CMO.

## Evaluation

This is not a formal competition, so results won't be measured using a strict metric. Rather, what one would like to see is a well-defined process of exploratory and statistical analysis with insightful conclusions.

1. Data Exploration - Was the data wrangled properly? How well was the data analyzed? Are there any useful visualizations? Does the reader learn any new techniques through this submission? A great entry will be informative and thought provoking.
2. Statistical Analysis - Were the right statistical tests used? How well was the statistical output interpreted? A great entry will interpret results without the use of any statistical jargon.
3. Business Recommendation - Were the recommendations tied to your analysis in Sections 1-3? Are they data-driven and focused on marketing concepts such as targets, channels, or products?
4. Documentation - Are your code, and notebook well documented so a reader can understand what you did? Are your sources clearly cited? A high quality analysis should be concise and clear at each step so the rationale is easy to follow and the process is reproducible.","","Business Analysis with EDA & Statistics","","","45"

eSports is a booming industry and there's not much publicly available data. With what's available here, conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and make some rational conclusions based off your findings.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns, to spot anomalies, to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations. ([Definition Source](https://towardsdatascience.com/exploratory-data-analysis-8fc1cb20fd15))

## Expected Submission

Submit a notebook that implements the full lifecycle of EDA mentioned above. Feel free to use this dataset plus any other data you have available. Since this is not a formal competition, please focus on doing your absolute best and don't compare yourself with others.

The notebook should be well documented and contain:

- Any steps you're taking to prepare the data, including references to external data sources
- Visualizations of explanations and vice versa

📌 Initial Statistical analysis of data
📌 Feature selection
📌 Approach to be followed for modeling

# Submission Details:

✔️ Word document to be submitted which lists down details of all the above points. Maximum 2 pages write up is allowed. Send email to colearninglounge@gmail.com with subject as “IPL Kaggle Task #1 – (Your Name)”. Any other subject line will not be entertained and would not be considered for evaluation.
✔️ Notebook to be submitted with all details.


## Important Note :

This task is to mainly understand the approach of solving a problem, the use of domain knowledge, etc. Prediction is the last but final thing. And yeah all points mentioned above will result in better prediction.
 
As the solution here is a statistical or Machine learning-based model we need to give importance to EDA, Feature engineering, Algorithm, etc.
No Black box here. Meaning no deep learning would help as much as ML can help.
 
Here final prediction is on the player list-making to the DT team for a specific match. Player point prediction is not in the scope of this competition.","","Model Approach","Statistical Analysis, Feature Selection and Model Approach","12/02/2020 23:59:00","1"

Perform regression analysis on the ads and develop a general model for predicting house prices  in Tbilisi. Use `housing_clean_2.csv` or your own clean CSV file. Avoid using the JSON file for this task.

## Expected Submission
Submit a notebook with a model that can predict previously unseen data with least **mean squared error**. Try to isolate all the data cleaning to a separate notebook, and use  the resulting CSV in your analysis notebook. That way it will be easier to see the results of your analysis. 
 
## Evaluation
The model will be trained on a fixed-size random subset of data and asked to predict the rest. The best predictor of unseen data wins.","","Perform regression analysis on house price","","","1"

After being a Minecraft Youtube Fan, creating this dataset for image generation with GANs and failing, the hope still remains with transfer learning and state-of-the-art models (StyleGAN...). Getting good results with transfer learning is a great part of generative networks, and the main goal behind is to get good results with small datasets, which normally is an impediment for most of the datasets.

## Submission
A good submission will have:
- 50 to 100 generated images
- A Kaggle notebook with the code and the generative algorithm

## Evaluation
The generated images will be passed through a minecraft front face skin binary classifier. The more images are passed as real, the better the score will be.

## Help resources
You can create your code with some of these notebooks that implement generative algorithms:
- [Keras DCGAN implementation](https://keras.io/examples/generative/dcgan_overriding_train_step/)

An prediction always starts with an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. This approach is a necessary step, since it's fundamental to tell us more about the data beyond the formal modeling and experimenting steps.

You'll be asked to state and answer interesting questions about the data by using a wide range of tools and techniques.

Some interesting questions about the data may include (although you can state more questions):
- What are the most acclaimed albums of each of the year in the millenium (2000-2020) by the users?
- What are the most hyped records year by year by the users.
- What artists generate the most hype?
- What are the most critically acclaimed artists of the millennium?
- Which genre generates the most feedback either from the critics and from the users?
- What are albums with the most negative reception, either from the critics and from the users?
- Which EP album was the most hyped?
- What release months are the most well received by the users and critics?
- Which records not well received by the users are most critically acclaimed?
- Which records not well received by the critic are the most acclaimed by the users?

## Expected Submission
A notebook that accomplishes the task.

## Evaluation
A good solution must perform better in these aspects:
- Documentation: of course an EDA must be well documented by including a description of each each step or conclusion and sources for your work. Every graph must be interpreted and questions must be clearly stated.
- Preparation: the current data is not entirely clean, so data preparation is a necessary step and it must be well documented.

In the file lasvegas.csv are 1,000 observations on mortgages for single family homes in Las Vegas, Nevada during 2008. The variable of interest is DELINQUENT, an indicator variable = 1 if the borrower missed at least three payments (90+ days late), but 0 otherwise. Explanatory variables: are LVR = the ratio of the loan amount to the value of the property; REF = 1 if purpose of the loan was a ‘‘refinance’’ and = 0 if loan was for a purchase; INSUR = 1 if mortgage carries mortgage insurance, 0 otherwise; RATE = initial interest rate of the mortgage; AMOUNT = dollar value of mortgage (in $100,000); CREDIT = credit score, TERM = number of years between disbursement of the loan and the date it is expected to be fully repaid, ARM = 1 if mortgage has an adjustable rate, and = 0 if mortgage has a fixed rate.

(a) Estimate probit model explaining DELINQUENT as a function of the remaining variables. Are the signs of the estimated coefficients reasonable?

(b) Compute the predicted value of DELINQUENT for the 500th and 1,000th observations using the probit model. Interpret the values.

(c) Calculate the probability of delinquency for CREDIT = 500, 600, and 700 for a loan of $250,000 (AMOUNT = 2.5). For the other variables, loan to value ratio (LVR) is 80%, initial interest rate is 8%, indicator variables take the value one, and TERM = 30.

(d) Compute the marginal effect of CREDIT on the probability of delinquency for CREDIT = 500, 600, and 700, given that the other explanatory variables take the values in (c). Discuss the interpretation of the marginal effect.

When I explored [when motorcycles crash](https://alexgude.com/blog/switrs-motorcycle-crashes-by-date/) I hypothotized that there were **two** types of riders:

- **Commuters**, who ride back and forth between work and most ride during the morning and evening commute on highways on practical, large motorcycles.
- **Recreational**, who ride for fun and are mostly out on the weekend, on sports bikes, and likely off of highways.

## Expected Submission

I would love to see a notebook that explores different makes and models and when they crash. The scientist should divide bikes into different categories either using something like Wikipedia's data or their own judgement to classify them as ""commuter bikes"" or ""sports bikes"" (and maybe ""other""). They should then look at if there is a statistically significant different in when and where crashes happen.

## Evaluation

A good solution should explore the motorcycle crash data, classify the different makes and models, and then look at when they crash and perhaps where. It should then use a statistical test to see if the different makes/models have different crash behavior.","","When do different makes and models of motorcycles crash?","Are sports bikes more likely to crash on the weekend?","","8"

When I first download the SWITRS data, I wanted to look at if crashes happened in different places during the weekday and the weekend. Maybe on weekdays most crashes would be on the highways whereas on weekends they'd happen on smaller, more fun to drive roads.

But unfortunately a lot of the locations are really noisy! Apparently the police sometimes round the numbers, as you can see in the plot off all the accidents below:

![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F6147881%2Fcb286ba665f7c3486c401f87c648e556%2F__results___8_0.png?generation=1607925715731890&alt=media)

There are even collisions in the middle of the ocean!

## Expected Submission

Can you put together a notebook that fixes this problem? Some points are too far gone to correct (like the crashes dozens of miles out in the Pacific ocean), but could other points be fixed by snapping to the nearest road? Or perhaps we can filter out points without enough precision?

## Evaluation

A good solution will contain both an algorithm (or multiple) to clean and filter the data. Ideally it would show a before and after for a zoomed in part of the map so we can clearly see that the crashes far from roads have been removed.

As states locked down in March 2020 due to COVID, people stopped driving to work and so the number of collisions decreased. You would expect this to reduce the fatality rate, but according to the [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration it did not](https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/2020-fatality-data-show-increased-traffic-fatalities-during-pandemic):

&gt; While Americans drove less in 2020 due to the pandemic, NHTSA’s early estimates show that an estimated 38,680 people died in motor vehicle traffic crashes—the largest projected number of fatalities since 2007. This represents an increase of about 7.2 percent as compared to the 36,096 fatalities reported in 2019.

Can we see this trend in the California data?

## Expected Submission

I would love to see notebooks that explore questions like:

- Did the fatality rate increase?
- Did the absolute number of fatalities increase?
- Does it differ by county?
- Can you see differences in the rate by type of cars? Do Corolla drivers drive safer than F150 drivers?

LUFlow '20 receives periodic updates with new attack telemetry captured by diverse honeypots. This ensures LUFlow '20 always incorporates evolving attack patterns. As the modern threat landscape contains ever-changing attacks orchestrated against critical infrastructure, it is now more than ever necessary to capture these attacks to defend against them. 

This task requests the analysis of LUFlow to identify the extent to which the attacks captured evolve over time. Furthermore, we are requesting the evaluation of classification algorithms to understand how effective older training data can be used to classify new data. Is it necessary to re-train models on new data in order detect the newer attacks captured and incorporated within LUFlow '20?


## Expected Submission
User's should submit notebooks which use multiple dates, e.g. once a week, of captured telemetry to establish whether the attacks captured in LUFlow '20 are evolving. This should include time-series analysis of attack properties.

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of re-training models on new data, users should create models using older training data and attempt to classify old and new data. If the results are not accurate enough, attempt to re-train with new data to understand how recent the training data must be to detect the most emerging attack patterns.


## Evaluation
Is there significant differences between old and new attacks within LUFlow '20?

Are the differences substantial enough to warrant the re-training of models to detect newer attacks?

Freely available demographic data reported by government agencies is often reported as counts within ranges (pre-binned). For instance, the IRS reports censored AGI data by zip code. While such data can provide general insights about a population, it can complicate the data scientist's ability to provide more granular insights.

In this task you are provided with censored salary data for employees of the California Community College system. Each campus reports the number of employees with salaries in specified ranges as well as the average salary of those employees, by employee category (see ReadMe and Directory descriptions for details). The top salary bracket is open ended which further complicates the problem.

Can you build a model that provides counts of employees by salary in $5000 intervals for each employee category each year? Use counts from all districts for this task as there is insufficient data to make individual models for most campuses.

## Expected Submission
Users should submit a notebook using the salary data provided by the California Community College Salaries dataset for the years 2001-2018. Feel free to use any freely available packages or tools. 

## Evaluation
A good submission will be a model which provides counts in $5000 intervals and reproduces the average salary reported. A great submission will be a model with smooth (i.e. does not directly replicate the steps in counts observed in the censored data) changes between $5000 brackets. An excellent submission will be a model that meets all of the previously mentioned goals and reproduces the original counts when re-binned according to the intervals of the censored data.

A company's market values are variable and affected by different factors. The most important factor could be the thoughts of the public. In this task, you are responsible to analyze the effect of public opinion about a company on that company's market values.

## Expected Submission
We are expecting a correlation rate that clarifies the public opinion vs market values. You can intuitively use a creative method to evaluate public opinion, but we prefer to use sentiment analysis. You can get help from different datasets or notebooks. But we leave a dataset here to reach the companies' market values.

This data set consists of the tweets about the top 6 NASDAQ companies. Every week, we read articles and news about their investments, projects, services and etc. As we experience new things about these companies, our thoughts change and we share them on social media. As a data scientist, you are responsible to visualize the public opinion of a company day by day. And explaining sudden declines and rises in this graph.


## Expected Submission
We expect you to submit a graph with comments that clarify the rapid changes. 
You do not need to reason for every decline or rise. The three biggest declines and rises are enough for this task.
For example, after the release of news that states Google has an attitude against the principle of data privacy, public opinion has changed to negative as 12.5% on January 1, 2017.

Each of these regions may have one or more teams from the ""Big 4"": NFL (football, in nfl.csv), MLB (baseball, in mlb.csv), NBA (basketball, in nba.csv or NHL (hockey, in nhl.csv). The task is from the perspective of the metropolitan region, and that this file is the ""source of authority"" for the location of a given sports team. Thus teams which are commonly known by a different area (e.g. ""Oakland Raiders"") need to be mapped into the metropolitan region given (e.g. San Francisco Bay Area). This will require some human data understanding outside of the data given (e.g. you will have to hand-code some names, and might need to google to find out where teams are)!


Task:

To check the hypothesis that given that an area has two sports teams in different sports, those teams will perform the same within their respective sports. Use a series of paired t-tests (so use ttest_rel) between all pairs of sports. Are there any sports where we can reject the null hypothesis? Again, average values where a sport has multiple teams in one region. Remember, you will only be including, for each sport, cities which have teams engaged in that sport, drop others as appropriate. Use data from year 2018 only for your analysis. The performance of the team can be determined by the Win to Loss ratio, so that needs to be computed and suitable statistical analysis should be performed.

Consider you are a Data Analyst with a private bank or a loan distribution firm. Your organization receives many applications in a given day. In order to process the applications, you sometimes miss out on accepting applications from people who are able to pay loans in time and end up sanctioning loans to those who later turn out to be defaulters.

**Datasets**
You are now provided with two datasets:

1. Current_app: This file gives you information on the existing loan applications. Whether or not clients have payment difficulties
2. Previous_app: This file contains information on the previous loan applications with status details of the previous applications being Approved, Cancelled, Refused or Unused offer.

Exploratory Data Analysis is really fun! You get to select how to approach the problem with the defined objectives. Here in this analysis, you are required to identify the loan application patterns and recommend the bank/firm on how they can build their loan portfolios and avoid giving loans to defaulters.

You have to recommend ways in which the bank/firm can maximize their loan sanction applications to the clients who can repay the installments. This can be really tricky since there could be new clients with no credit history and can take advantage of the bank and turn out to be defaulters in the future.","","Credit Analysis","","","0"

Background of Problem Statement :

The US Census Bureau has published California Census Data which has 10 types of metrics such as the population, median income, median housing price, and so on for each block group in California. The dataset also serves as an input for project scoping and tries to specify the functional and nonfunctional requirements for it.

Problem Objective :

The project aims at building a model of housing prices to predict median house values in California using the provided dataset. This model should learn from the data and be able to predict the median housing price in any district, given all the other metrics.

Districts or block groups are the smallest geographical units for which the US Census Bureau
publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people). There are 20,640 districts in the project dataset.

Domain: Finance and Housing

Analysis Tasks to be performed:

1. Build a model of housing prices to predict median house values in California using the provided dataset.

2. Train the model to learn from the data to predict the median housing price in any district, given all the other metrics.

3. Predict housing prices based on median_income and plot the regression chart for it.

1. Load the data :

Read the “housing.csv” file from the folder into the program.
Print first few rows of this data.
Extract input (X) and output (Y) data from the dataset.
2. Handle missing values :

Fill the missing values with the mean of the respective column.
3. Encode categorical data :

Convert categorical column in the dataset to numerical data.
4. Split the dataset : 

Split the data into 80% training dataset and 20% test dataset.
5. Standardize data :

Standardize training and test datasets.
6. Perform Linear Regression : 

Perform Linear Regression on training data.
Predict output for test dataset using the fitted model.
Print root mean squared error (RMSE) from Linear Regression.
            [ HINT: Import mean_squared_error from sklearn.metrics ]

7. Bonus exercise: Perform Linear Regression with one independent variable :

Extract just the median_income column from the independent variables (from X_train and X_test).
Perform Linear Regression to predict housing values based on median_income.
Predict output for test dataset using the fitted model.
Plot the fitted model for training data as well as for test data to check if the fitted model satisfies the test data.

I kind of struggle with how to do it. So, the result is not on the expected level. Because of my knowledge of Kaggle, and also most importantly R programming and Statistics. 

I couldn't find a common ground GDPR related search results. The first reason is, on GPDR's website [key issues](https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/) ordered 12 keywords.  The second reason is; I thought that I could find a relationship between those keywords if I look for their searching results. Because, in my mind, I thought people would search those keywords as soon as they read GDPR's articles. My thought process might be biased. Another because the countries in the EU are well-regulated, and people constantly update their knowledge on the new regulations. Little did I know, the world does not run like that :) People think differently! We approach things differently. That makes us unique!

With that being said, I am looking for a task that contains clustered data about [the key issues](https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/) in GDPR. My expected submission could be a notebook, code, or dataset. The decision will be yours only. On the evaluation part, I will be evaluated the submissions on the basis of K-means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Principal Components Analysis, and the other methods that contain clustering algorithms.

This paper used multiple regression techniques as the methodology for its findings. You should read it for background, as it is the genesis of the models that you will be given. The data that you are analyzing is synthetic. That is, the TA used a model to generate the data. Your task is to find the model that the TA used for your data. For example, one possible model is  
 . 
Y = u + E1:E2 + E3:G4 + N(0,sigma^2)

The class blackboard also contains a paper by Risch et al. that uses a larger collection of data to assess the findings in Caspi et al. These researchers confirmed that Caspi et al. calculated their results correctly but that no other dataset had the relation reported in Caspi et al. That is, Caspi et al. seem to have reported a false positive (Type I error). The class blackboard contains a recent paper about the genetics of mental illness and a technical appendix giving the specifics. Together these papers are an example of the response of the research community to studying the genetics of mental illness, which is a notoriously difficult research area. 

Guidelines for analysis

The first task for this problem is to use the statistical package of your choice to find the correlations between the independent variables and the dependent variable. Transformations of variables may be necessary. The Box-Cox transformation may find potentially nonlinear transformations of a dependent variable. After selecting the transformations of the dependent variable, use model building methods such as stepwise regression to select the important independent variables. The TA will use at most four-way interactions of the independent variables (that is, terms like or E1:E2:G1:G2 ) in generating your data. There may also be non-linear environmental variables, such as  E1^2 or E4^0.5 . 

 
Hints

Remember to consider multiple testing issues. The p-value for the variables that you select should be much smaller than 0.01. Remember that you have 6 environmental variables, 20 genes, 120 gene-environment variables, 190 gene-gene interaction variables, and so on.","","Multiple Regression Analysis","","","4"

Note: This is an individual assignment.

Project Brief
You work for Spark Funds, an asset management company. Spark Funds wants to make investments in a few companies. The CEO of Spark Funds wants to understand the global trends in investments so that she can take the investment decisions effectively.

 

Business and Data Understanding
Spark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:

It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment

It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in

For your analysis, consider a country to be English speaking only if English is one of the official languages in that country

You may use this list: Click here for a list of countries where English is an official language.

 

These conditions will give you sufficient information for your initial analysis. Before getting to specific questions, let’s understand the problem and the data first.

 

1. What is the strategy?

Spark Funds wants to invest where most other investors are investing. This pattern is often observed among early stage startup investors.

 

2. Where did we get the data from? 

We have taken real investment data from crunchbase.com, so the insights you get may be incredibly useful. For this assignment, we have divided the data into the following files:

 

You have to use three main data tables for the entire analysis (available for download on the next page):

 

3. What is Spark Funds’ business objective?

The business objectives and goals of data analysis are pretty straightforward.

Business objective: The objective is to identify the best sectors, countries, and a suitable investment type for making investments. The overall strategy is to invest where others are investing, implying that the 'best' sectors and countries are the ones 'where most investors are investing'.
Goals of data analysis: Your goals are divided into three sub-goals:
Investment type analysis: Comparing the typical investment amounts in the venture, seed, angel, private equity etc. so that Spark Funds can choose the type that is best suited for their strategy.
Country analysis: Identifying the countries which have been the most heavily invested in the past. These will be Spark Funds’ favourites as well.
Sector analysis: Understanding the distribution of investments across the eight main sectors. (Note that we are interested in the eight 'main sectors' provided in the mapping file. The two files — companies and rounds2 — have numerous sub-sector names; hence, you will need to map each sub-sector to its main sector.)
 

4. How do you approach the assignment? What are the deliverables?

The entire assignment is divided into checkpoints to help you navigate. For each checkpoint, you are advised to fill in the tables into the spreadsheet provided in the download segment. The tables are also mentioned under the 'Results Expected' section after each checkpoint. Since this is the first assignment, you have been provided with some additional guidance. Going forward you will be expected to structure and solve the problem by yourself, just like you would be solving problems in real life scenarios.","","Investment Analysis","","","1"

    In this project we will try to predict the AQI using the temperature datas. We will also search which weather condition has higher effect on air quality. We will use Shanghai as the base city, since the air quality of Shanghai has seasonal air conditions, close to sea and has low air quality. 


Air Quality Index (AQI) is measured with the indicators below.  
PM 2.5

    Though invisible to the naked eye, the air we breathe is loaded with tiny particulates made up of chemicals, allergens, dust, smoke, or soil in the formof (microscopic) solids, gases or liquids. When we burn fossil fuels forproduction, energy or mobility, it generates chemicals and gases whichpollute the air. This poses a risk to human health and earth as awhole. One of the most minuscule categories of these airborne hazards are called particulate matter (PM) 2.5 

PM10
    
    Organic particles, or particulate matter, as in smoke, measuring between 2.5 and 10 microns in diameter.

Ozone (O3)

    Ozone is a gas whose molecules are composed of three oxygen atoms. Ozone is not emitted directly into the air, but is created by a chemical reaction between two precursors — oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) — in the presence of sunlight. 

Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)

    Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is one of a group of highly reactive gases known as nitrogen oxides (NOX). NO2 forms quickly from emissions from cars, trucks and buses, power plants, off-road equipment and other combustion sources. In addition to contributing to the formation of ground-level ozone and fine particle pollution, NO2 is associated with a number of adverse effects on the human respiratory system. 

Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)

    Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a highly reactive gas, and the largest sources of SO2 emissions are power plants and other industrial facilities that combust fossil fuels. Smaller sources of SO2 emissions include the burning of high sulfur-containing fuels by locomotives and non-road equipment, and non-combustion industrial processes, such as extracting metal from ore. SO2 is linked with a number of adverse effects on the respiratory system. 

Carbon Monoxide (CO)

    Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas emitted directly from motor vehicles, off-road equipment, and other sources of equipment powered by fossil-fuels. High CO concentrations are a health concern because the pollutant is readily absorbed through the lungs into the blood, where it binds with hemoglobin and reduces the ability of the blood to carry oxygen. 

Air Quality Index and Effects on Human Health

Depending on how healthy a person is, fine particulate matter will have various short term and long term health impacts. If you are exposed to levels between ""Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups"" (AQI 100) to ""Hazardous"" (300+), you might experience one or more of the following effects:

• Asthma attacks

• Lowered heart function, possibly leading in heart attack

• Reduced lung function and exacerbation of lung conditions

• Wheezing or coughing

• Throat, nose or eye irritation

• Shortness of breath 

# According to both feature selection models the fallowing weather conditions has the highest impact on the AQI 

1) Minimum Temp C

2) Feels Like C 

3) UV Index : 
The ultraviolet index, or UV index, is an international standard measurement of the strength of sunburn-producing ultraviolet (UV) radiation at a particular place and time.

4) DewPointC : 
Represents the temperature to which air would have to be cooled to reach a level of moisture saturation. When it reaches the dew point, droplets of water, or dew, begin to form on solid objects like grass and cars.

5) Heat Index C : 
represents how hot the temperature actually feels when humidity is considered. The more humid the air is, the less perspiration is able to evaporate, which cripples the human body’s cooling system and makes it feel hotter when it’s humid outside.

6) Wind Chill C : 
Also known as the “feels-like” temperature, wind chill represents how cold the weather feels on human skin when the chilling effect of the wind is taken into consideration.","","Temperature and Climate effects on AIR QUALITY INDEX (AQI) based on Shanghai measurements","Temperature and Climate effects on AIR QUALITY INDEX (AQI) based on Shanghai measurements","03/05/2021 23:59:00","0"

Film, also called movie, motion picture or moving picture, is a visual art-form used to simulate experiences that communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty, or atmosphere through the use of moving images. These images are generally accompanied by sound, and more rarely, other sensory stimulations.[1] The word “cinema”, short for cinematography, is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry, and to the art form that is the result of it.
❏ STREAMING MEDIA ❏
Streaming media is multimedia that is constantly received by and presented to an end-user while being delivered by a provider. The verb to stream refers to the process of delivering or obtaining media in this manner.[clarification needed] Streaming refers to the delivery method of the medium, rather than the medium itself. Distinguishing delivery method from the media distributed applies specifically to telecommunications networks, as most of the delivery systems are either inherently streaming (e.g. radio, television, streaming apps) or inherently non-streaming (e.g. books, video cassettes, audio CDs). There are challenges with streaming content on the Internet. For example, users whose Internet connection lacks sufficient bandwidth may experience stops, lags, or slow buffering of the content. And users lacking compatible hardware or software systems may be unable to stream certain content.
Live streaming is the delivery of Internet content in real-time much as live television broadcasts content over the airwaves via a television signal. Live internet streaming requires a form of source media (e.g. a video camera, an audio interface, screen capture software), an encoder to digitize the content, a media publisher, and a content delivery network to distribute and deliver the content. Live streaming does not need to be recorded at the origination point, although it frequently is.
Streaming is an alternative to file downloading, a process in which the end-user obtains the entire file for the content before watching or listening to it. Through streaming, an end-user can use their media player to start playing digital video or digital audio content before the entire file has been transmitted. The term “streaming media” can apply to media other than video and audio, such as live closed captioning, ticker tape, and real-time text, which are all considered “streaming text”.
❏ COPYRIGHT CONTENT ❏
Copyright is a type of intellectual property that gives its owner the exclusive right to make copies of a creative work, usually for a limited time.[1][2][3][4][5] The creative work may be in a literary, artistic, educational, or musical form. Copyright is intended to protect the original expression of an idea in the form of a creative work, but not the idea itself.[6][7][8] A copyright is subject to limitations based on public interest considerations, such as the fair use doctrine in the United States.
Some jurisdictions require “fixing” copyrighted works in a tangible form. It is often shared among multiple authors, each of whom holds a set of rights to use or license the work, and who are commonly referred to as rights holders.[citation needed][9][10][11][12] These rights frequently include reproduction, control over derivative works, distribution, public performance, and moral rights such as attribution.[13]
Copyrights can be granted by public law and are in that case considered “territorial rights”. This means that copyrights granted by the law of a certain state, do not extend beyond the territory of that specific jurisdiction. Copyrights of this type vary by country; many countries, and sometimes a large group of countries, have made agreements with other countries on procedures applicable when works “cross” national borders or national rights are inconsistent.[14]
Typically, the public law duration of a copyright expires 50 to 100 years after the creator dies, depending on the jurisdiction. Some countries require certain copyright formalities[5] to establishing copyright, others recognize copyright in any completed work, without a formal registration.
It is widely believed that copyrights are a must to foster cultural diversity and creativity. However, Parc argues that contrary to prevailing beliefs, imitation and copying do not restrict cultural creativity or diversity but in fact support them further. This argument has been supported by many examples such as Millet and Van Gogh, Picasso, Manet, and Monet, etc.[15]
❏ GOODS OF SERVICES ❏
Credit (from Latin credit, “(he/she/it) believes”) is the trust which allows one party to provide money or resources to another party wherein the second party does not reimburse the first party immediately (thereby generating a debt), but promises either to repay or return those resources (or other materials of equal value) at a later date.[1] In other words, credit is a method of making reciprocity formal, legally enforceable, and extensible to a large group of unrelated people.
The resources provided may be financial (e.g. granting a loan), or they may consist of goods or services (e.g. consumer credit). Credit encompasses any form of deferred payment.[2] Credit is extended by a creditor, also known as a lender, to a debtor, also known as a borrower.","","EXCLUSIVE!

Its somewhat ironic that a movie about time travel can’t be reviewed properly until your future self rewatches the movie.
It’s bold of Nolan to make such a thoroughly dense blockbuster. He assumes people will actually want to see WAY DOWN more than once so they can understand it properly, which some may not. This movie makes the chronology of Inception look as simplistic as tic-tac-toe.
Ergo, it’s hard for me to give an accurate rating, without having seen it twice, as I’m still trying to figure out whether everything does indeed make sense. If it does, this movie is easily a 9 or 10. If it doesn’t, it’s a 6.
It’s further not helped by the fact that the dialogue in the first 15 minutes of the movie is painfully hard to understand / hear. Either they were behind masks; they were practically mumbling; the sound effects were too loud; or all of the above. The exposition scenes are also waayyy too brief for something this complex — a problem also shared with WAY DOWN actually.
(WAY DOWN had this minimalist exposition problem explaining Blight, where if you weren’t careful, you’d miss this one sentence / scene in the entire movie explaining that Blight was a viral bacteria:
“Earth’s atmosphere is 80% nitrogen, we don’t even breathe nitrogen. Blight does, and as it thrives, our air gets less and less oxygen”).
I guess it’s a Nolan quirk. Hopefully, a revision of the film audio sorts the sound mixing out. I do like the soundtrack, but it’s too loud initially.
I liked all the actors. You think John Washington can’t act at first, but he can, and he grows on you as the film progresses. And Pattinson is his usual charming self. Elizabeth is a surprise treat. And so on.
Its worth a watch either way. See it with subtitles if you can. And definitely don’t expect to fully understand whats going on the first time around.
Its one hell of a complicated film. It will be very hard for an average viewer to gather all the information provided by this movie at the first watch. But the more you watch it, more hidden elements will come to light. And when you are able to put these hidden elements together. You will realize that this movie is just a “masterpiece” which takes the legacy of Christopher Nolan Forward
If I talk about acting, Then I have to say that Robert Pattinson has really proved himself as a very good actor in these recent years. And I am sure his acting skills will increase with time. His performance is charming and very smooth. Whenever he is on the camera, he steals the focus John David Washington is also fantastic in this movie. His performance is electrifying, I hope to see more from him in the future. Other characters such as Kenneth Branagh, Elizabeth, Himesh Patel, Dimple Kapadia, Clémence Poésy have also done quite well. And I dont think there is a need to talk about Michael Caine
Talking about Music, its awesome. I dont think you will miss Hans Zimmer’s score. Ludwig has done a sufficient job. There is no lack of good score in the movie
Gotta love the editing and post production which has been put into this movie. I think its fair to say this Nolan film has focused more in its post production. The main problem in the movie is the sound mixing. Plot is already complex and some dialogues are very soft due to the high music score. It makes it harder to realize what is going on in the movie. Other Nolan movies had loud BGM too. But Audio and dialogues weren’t a problem
My humble request to everyone is to please let the movie sink in your thoughts. Let your mind grasp all the elements of this movie. I am sure more people will find it better. Even those who think they got the plot. I can bet they are wrong.
WAY DOWN is the long awaited new movie from Christopher Nolan. The movie that’s set to reboot the multiplexes post-Covid. It’s a manic, extremely loud, extremely baffling sci-fi cum spy rollercoaster that will please a lot of Nolan fan-boys but which left me with very mixed views.
John David Washington (Denzel’s lad) plays “The Protagonist” — a crack-CIA field operative who is an unstoppable one-man army in the style of Hobbs or Shaw. Recruited into an even more shadowy organisation, he’s on the trail of an international arms dealer, Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh in full villain mode). Sator is bullying his estranged wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki) over custody of their son (and the film unusually has a BBFC warning about “Domestic Abuse”). Our hero jets the world to try to prevent a very particular kind of Armageddon while also keeping the vulnerable and attractive Kat alive.
This is cinema at its biggest and boldest. Nolan has taken a cinema ‘splurge’ gun, filled it with money, set it on rapid fire, removed the safety and let rip at the screen. Given that Nolan is famous for doing all of his ‘effects’ for real and ‘in camera’, some of what you see performed is almost unbelievable. You thought crashing a train through rush-hour traffic in “Inception” was crazy? You ain’t seen nothing yet with the airport scene! And for lovers of Chinooks (I must admit I am one and rush out of the house to see one if I hear it coming!) there is positively Chinook-p*rn on offer in the film’s ridiculously huge finale.
The ‘inversion’ aspects of the story also lends itself to some fight scenes — one in particular in an airport ‘freeport’ — which are both bizarre to watch and, I imagine, technically extremely challenging to pull off. In this regard John David Washington is an acrobatic and talented stunt performer in his own right, and must have trained for months for this role.
Nolan’s crew also certainly racked up their air miles pre-lockdown, since the locations range far and wide across the world. The locations encompassed Denmark, Estonia, India, Italy, Norway, the United Kingdom, and United States. Hoyte Van Hoytema’s cinematography is lush in introducing these, especially the beautiful Italian coast scenes. Although I did miss the David Arnold strings that would typically introduce these in a Bond movie: it felt like that was missing.
The ‘timey-wimey’ aspects of the plot are also intriguing and very cleverly done. There are numerous points at which you think “Oh, that’s a sloppy continuity error” or “Shame the production design team missed that cracked wing mirror”. Then later in the movie, you get at least a dozen “Aha!” moments. Some of them (no spoilers) are jaw-droppingly spectacular.
Perhaps the best twist is hidden in the final line of the movie. I only processed it on the way home.
And so to the first of my significant gripes with WAY DOWN. The sound mix in the movie is all over the place. I’d go stronger than that… it’s truly awful (expletive deleted)! Nolan often implements Shakespeare’s trick of having characters in the play provide exposition of the plot to aid comprehension. But unfortunately, all of this exposition dialogue was largely incomprehensible. This was due to:
the ear-splitting volume of the sound: 2021 movie audiences are going to be suffering from ‘WAY DOWNis’! (LOL);
the dialogue is poorly mixed with the thumping music by Ludwig Göransson (Wot? No Hans Zimmer?);
a large proportion of the dialogue was through masks of varying description (#covid-appropriate). Aaron Taylor-Johnson was particularly unintelligible to my ears.
Overall, watching this with subtitles at a special showing might be advisable!
OK, so I only have a PhD in Physics… but at times I was completely lost as to the intricacies of the plot. It made “Inception” look like “The Tiger Who Came to Tea”. There was an obvious ‘McGuffin’ in “Inception” — — (“These ‘dream levels’… how exactly are they architected??”…. “Don’t worry… they’ll never notice”. And we didn’t!) In “WAY DOWN” there are McGuffins nested in McGuffins. So much of this is casually waved away as “future stuff… you’re not qualified” that it feels vaguely condescending to the audience. At one point Sator says to Kat “You don’t know what’s going on, do you?” and she shakes her head blankly. We’re right with you there luv!
There are also gaps in the storyline that jar. The word “WAY DOWN”? What does it mean. Is it just a password? I’m none the wiser.
The manic pace of WAY DOWN and the constant din means that the movie gallops along like a series of disconnected (albeit brilliant) action set pieces. For me, it has none of the emotional heart of the Cobb’s marriage problems from “Inception” or the father/daughter separation of “WAY DOWN”. In fact, you barely care for anyone in the movie, perhaps with the exception of Kat.
It’s a talented cast. As mentioned above, John David Washington is muscular and athletic in the role. It’s a big load for the actor to carry in such a tent-pole movie, given his only significant starring role before was in the excellent BlacKkKlansman. But he carries it off well. A worthy successor to Gerard Butler and Jason Statham for action roles in the next 10 years.
This is also a great performance by Robert Pattinson, in his most high-profile film in a long time, playing the vaguely alcoholic and Carré-esque support guy. Pattinson’s Potter co-star Clemence Poésy also pops up — rather more un-glam that usual — as the scientist plot-expositor early in the movie.
Nolan’s regular Michael Caine also pops up. although the 87-year old legend is starting to show his age: His speech was obviously affected at the time of filming (though nice try Mr Nolan in trying to disguise that with a mouth full of food!). But in my book, any amount of Caine in a movie is a plus. He also gets to deliver the best killer line in the film about snobbery!
However, it’s Kenneth Branagh and Elizabeth Debicki that really stand out. They were both fabulous, especially when they were bouncing off each other in their marital battle royale.
So, given this was my most anticipated movie of the year, it’s a bit of a curate’s egg for me. A mixture of being awe-struck at times and slightly disappointed at others. It’s a movie which needs a second watch, so I’m heading back today to give my ear drums another bashing! And this is one where I reserve the right to revisit my rating after that second watch… it’s not likely to go down… but it might go up.
(For the full graphical review, check out One Mann’s Movies on t’interweb and Facebook. Thanks.)
As this will be non-spoiler, I can’t say too much about the story. However, what I can is this: WAY DOWN’s story is quite dynamic in the sense that you won’t understand it till it wants you to. So, for the first half, your brain is fighting for hints and pieces to puzzle together the story. It isn’t until halfway through the movie that WAY DOWN invites you to the fantastic storytelling by Christopher Nolan.
Acting is beyond phenomenal, and I’d be genuinely surprised if neither Robert Pattinson nor John David Washington doesn’t receive an Oscar nomination for best actor. It’s also hard not to mention how good Elizabeth Debicki and Aaron Johnson both are. All around, great acting, and the dialogue amps up the quality of the movie.
The idea of this movie is damn fascinating, and while there are films that explore time-travelling, there’s never been anything quite like this. It has such a beautiful charm and for the most part, explains everything thoroughly. It feels so much more complex than any form of time-travelling we’ve seen, and no less could’ve been expected from Nolan.
Oh my lord, the score for this film fits so perfectly. Every scene that’s meant to feel intense was amped by a hundred because of how good the score was. Let me just say though, none of them will be found iconic, but they fit the story and scenes so well.
In the end, I walked out, feeling very satisfied. Nevertheless, I do have issues with the film that I cannot really express without spoiling bits of the story. There are definitely little inconsistencies that I found myself uncovering as the story progressed. However, I only had one issue that I found impacted my enjoyment. That issue was understanding some of the dialogue. No, not in the sense that the movie is too complicated, but more that it was hard to make out was being said at times. It felt like the movie required subtitles, but that probably was because, at a time in the film, there was far too much exposition.
Nevertheless, I loved this film, I’ll be watching it at least two more times, and I think most of you in this group will enjoy it. I definitely suggest watching it in theatres if possible, just so you can get that excitement.
(4/5) & (8.5/10) for those that care about number scores.","","Way Down 2021 VOLLEDIGE FILM Streaming","Way Down 2021 VOLLEDIGE FILM Streaming","01/23/2021 23:59:00","0"

The usage statistics are interesting on their own, but they could include even more helpful information. The idea behind this task is to take Pokedex data from this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fruityfritz/generation-8-pokedex) and merge it with the usage statistics given here.

## Expected Submission
The submission should simply be a `csv` or similar type of data file that contains information from the usage statistics and Pokedex datasets. There should be a dataset for each month of usage statistics data.

## Evaluation
There are two main criteria:
-  Make sure the submission can iterate over all the datasets in this database or the final dataset is made by calling a function.
- Make sure your code is generalizable to new months of data.","","Merge Usage and Pokedex Data","Include typical Pokedex data with the Usage data","","0"

The moveset data contains information on the relative percentage of items used by each Pokemon. This task is meant to synthesize that information to determine which items are the most commonly used in general.

## Expected Submission
This solution can be solved using notebooks primarily and the datasets provided in this database. Submissions can use data from each month separately or the aggregated data - whatever the user would like. 

## Evaluation
The top five items should be displayed. There are two ways to consider the items usage statistics:
1. **Unweighted**: Under this scheme, you would look at each of the items used by each Pokemon and simply count the instances of a certain item. The item with the most instances would be the most common.
2. **Weighted**: A more complex procedure would be to take the ideas from the Unweighted scheme and weight the item instances by Pokemon usage. For instance, Incineroar has a high usage statistic which would weight the items typically used on this Pokemon more than a Pokemon like Crobat who has much less usage.","","Most Common Items","What are the most common items in VGC Series 7?","","0"

For this code to work, you need to load the rus.txt file into Colab.

We read the lines from this file, parse them and put the sentences in the input_texts andtarget_texts lists (input and output sentences, respectively).

Preparing dictionaries
As before, we will use one character (not a word) as an element of the sequence. This is fine for our simple short sentence task.

Let's prepare two dictionaries (mapping index to character and character to index), and we will do this for input texts (input_texts) and output texts (target_texts), since they are in different languages and consist of different characters.

In addition, we need special tokens for the beginning and end of the chain (","","Machine translate","Test your knowledge in machine translation","","0"

### ittihat ve terakki cemiyeti uzantıları sayesinde Tunus, Mısır, Kıbrıs, Sırbıstan, Karadağ ve Romanya olmak üzere 1 milyon 592 bin 806 kilometre kare toprak kaybedilmiştir.
Sultan Abdülhamid Han ın tahtta kaldığı tarihler 31 Ağustos 1876 – 27 Nisan 1909

### Birinci Meşrutiyet, Osmanlı İmparatorluğu'nda 23 Aralık 1876'da II. Abdülhamid tarafından ilan edilen, anayasal monarşi rejiminin ilk dönemi.
Meşrutiyet dönemi meclis dönemine geçiş sürecidir yani tek karar merci meclistir.

## İttihat ve terakki uzantılarının  Başarısız şekilde yönetmesi elbette toprak kayıplarına neden olacaktır.
Zaten tek karar merci padişah olmuş olsaydı ne toprak kaybı olur ne de kendi başarısızlıklarını padişaha yükleyip onu tahttan indirebilirlerdi.

## Gelin ondan öncesine gidelim bakın ne yapmış bu hain uzantılar

### Daha önce Sened-i İttifak (1808) ile başlayan, padişahın yetkilerini kısma süreci, Tanzimat (1839) ve Islahat (1856) Fermanları ile devam etmiş, ancak Ali ve Fuat Paşaların ölümleriyle birlikte bir duraklama evresine girmişti.

### İlerleyen yıllarda İtalya’nın ihtilal mantalitesine sahip olan Carbonari örgütünü örnek alarak 1865 yılında “Genç Osmanlılar Cemiyeti” adı altında gizli bir örgüt kurmuşlar ve meşruti rejimi kurmak için ihtilal yoluna başvurmuşlardı. İlk olarak da, 1867 yılında Babıâli’yi basarak Sadrazam Ali Paşa’yı indirerek Mahmut Nedim Paşa’yı sadrazamlığa getirmek istemişlerdi. Ancak hükümet bu durumu önceden haber almış ve cemiyetin pek çok üyesi tutuklanmıştı. Kurtulabilenler ise Avrupa’ya kaçmışlar ve “sadrazam Fuad Paşa ile geçinmediği için Avrupa’ya gitmiş olan Mustafa Fazıl Paşa’nın ekonomik desteğinde, daha sistemli ve gür sesli bir muhalefeti başlatmışlardı”.Etkin muhalefetlerini bir süre daha devam ettiren cemiyet; mali sıkıntı, Sultan Abdülaziz’in ümit verici konuşmaları ve 1871 yılında Ali Paşa’nın ölümü gibi nedenler ışığında muhalefetlerine ara vermişler ve üyelerin büyük bir bölümü ülkelerine dönmüşlerdi.


### Ancak, meşruti bir idarenin kurulmasını ana gaye edinen ve başını Mahmut Nedim Paşa’nın çektiği grup, bu yöndeki faaliyetlerine devam etmişler ve bu uğurda yapılacak her yolu da mübah görmüşlerdi. Nitekim, ümitlerini kestikleri Sultan Abdülaziz’i bir darbe ile tahttan indirerek bunu açıkça göstermişlerdi.Sultan Abdülaziz’i tahttan indiren darbeciler, birkaç gün sonra onu öldürerek intihar süsü vermişler ve işbirliği içinde oldukları V. Murad’ı tahta çıkarmışlardı. Ne yazık ki, meşrutiyetin ilanı için umut bağladıkları V. Murad’ın, yaşanan gelişmelerden dolayı ruh sağlığı bozulmuş ve V. Murad, bu halinden dolayı sadece 3 ay tahtta kalabilmişti. V. Murad’ın da böylece tahttan inmesi üzerine, Veliaht Abdülhamid Efendi’nin önemi bir kat daha artmış ve meşrutiyetçiler, istemeyerek de olsa Abdülhamid’e umut bağlamışlardı.
Bunun üzerine Mithat Paşa, Abdülhamid ile görüşmüş ve meşrutiyeti ilan edeceğini vadeden Abdülhamid, 31 Ağustos 1876 Perşembe günü büyük bir törenle tahta cülus etmişti.Balkanların fokur fokur kaynadığı, üst üste gelen taht değişiklikleri, devletin içine girdiği ekonomik sıkıntılar gibi kaotik bir dönemde tahtta geçen II. Abdülhamid’i bekleyen pek çok sorun vardı ve bunlardan biri de meşrutiyetin ilanı hadisesiydi. Nihayet Mithat Paşa’nın tazyikleri ile anayasa çalışmaları başlamış ve 23 Aralık 1876 tarihinde Osmanlı Devleti’nin ilk anayasası olan Kanun-ı Esasi yüz bir pare top atışıyla ilan edilmişti.Sened-i İttifak yani PADİŞAHIN YETKİLERİNİ KISMA SÜRECİ ile başlayan sürecin önemli bir ürünü olarak ortaya çıkan Kanun-ı Esasi’nin alelacele ilan edilmesinde “diplomatik bir taktik” vardı. Şöyle ki, “1875 Hersek Ayaklanması’yla başlayan olaylar Rusya ile Osmanlı Devletini karşı karşıya getirmiş ve Osmanlı kuvvetlerinin 29 Ekim1876’da tarihinde Osmanlı Devleti’nin ilk anayasası olan Kanun-ı Esasi yüz bir pare top atışıyla ilan edilmişti.Sened-i İttifak ile başlayan sürecin önemli bir ürünü olarak ortaya çıkan Kanun-ı Esasi’nin alelacele ilan edilmesinde “diplomatik bir taktik” vardı. Şöyle ki, “1875 Hersek Ayaklanması’yla başlayan olaylar Rusya ile Osmanlı Devletini karşı karşıya getirmiş ve Osmanlı kuvvetlerinin 29 Ekim1876’da Morova’da Sırp kuvvetlerine sağladığı üstünlükten sonra Rus hükümeti Babıâli’ye bir ültimatom vermişti. Bu dönemde Osmanlı’nın toprak bütünlüğünden yana olan İngiltere ise bu ültimatoma karşı bir konferansın toplanması önerisinde bulunmuştu. Bu önerinin kabul edilmesi üzerine Büyük Devletler, “Doğu Sorunu”nun çözümünde çıkarlarını uzlaştırmak için İstanbul’da bir araya gelmişlerdi”.İstanbul Konferansı ya da toplandığı Haliç Tersanesi’ne izafeten Tersane Konferansı 23 Aralık’ta toplanmış ve “bütün devlet temsilcilerinin hazır bulunduğu esnada ‘dışarıdan dehşetli bir surette atılmaya başlayan top sesleri’ duyulmuştu. Bunun üzerine Hariciye Nazırı söz alarak delegelere, padişahın halkın meşru isteklerine göre uygulanmasını gerekli gördüğü yeni idare yönteminden ve meşrutiyet idaresinin getirdiği özgürlüklerden bahisle, ‘bu inkılâp karşısında toplantının zait(gereksiz) kaldığını’ dile getirmişti”. Ancak delegeler Kanun-ı Esasi’nin ilanına pek itibar etmemişler ve bu hareketi, “diplomatik bir taktik” olarak addetmişlerdi. Sonrada, hiçbir şey olmamış gibi kaldıkları yerden görüşmelere devam etmişlerdi. Meşrutiyetin ilanı, konferansa katılan delegeler üzerinde herhangi bir olumlu tesir uyandırmamasına rağmen, İstanbul’da bulunan Gayr-ı Müslim cemaat üyeleri tarafından büyük bir coşku ve bayram havası içinde kutlanmıştı. Neticede, Osmanlı Devleti, devletin bütünlüğüne ve bağımsızlığına büyük bir darbe vuran maddeler ihtiva eden konferansın kararlarını reddetmiş ve zaten savaş için fırsat kollayan Rusya, bunu bahane ederek Nisan 1877’de Osmanlı Devleti’ne savaş ilan etmişti. Böylece, Osmanlı Devleti için büyük bir felaketle sonuçlanan 1877–78 (93 Harbi) Osmanlı-Rus savaşı...

Here in this assignment, I am coding for the Data exploration.

**Data Exploration Assignment**

**Problem Statement:**

Consider yourself to be Sam, who is a Data Scientist at ‘Verizon’. In the past 6 months customers of your company have been churning out to other networks. So, you as a data scientist have to understand what are the factors leading to the customers churning out and what can you do to reduce the churn rate.
Sam starts off with data exploration. So, Sam wants to understand the structure of the data first.

**Questions on Data Extraction:**

1.	Extract these individual columns with the ‘$’ symbol:
1. a.	Extract ‘InternetService’ column and store it in ‘customer_internet_service’
1. b.	Extract ‘PaperlessBilling’ column and store it in ‘customer_Paperless_Billing’
1. c.	Extract ‘StreamingTV’ column and store it in ‘customer_Streaming_TV’

2.	Extract the 3rd, 6th and 9th columns from the ‘customer_churn’ data.frame & store it in ‘customer_random_columns’

3.	Extract all the columns from column number-10 to column-number 20 and store the result in ‘customer_10_20’

4.	Extract only these row numbers: 65, 765, 3726 & 7000 and store the result in ‘customer_random_rows’

5.	Extract all the rows starting from row number-655 to row number-6550 & store the result in ‘customer_continuous_rows’

6.	Extract row numbers- 10, 100 & 1000 & column numbers- 5, 10, 15 & store the result in ‘customer_random_data’


Now, Sam decides to implement some flow control statements to explore the data


**Questions on Flow Control Statements:**

1.	Check if the value in the 6th cell of ‘PaymentMethod’ column is ‘Electronic check’. If yes, print “Yes, the payment method is Electronic check”

2.	Check the value present in 12th cell of ‘Contract’ column. 
If it’s ‘month-to-month’, print ‘The contract is on a month to month basis’
If it’s ‘One year’, print ‘The contract is on a yearly basis’
If it’s ‘Two year’, print ‘The contract is on a two-year basis’

3.	Use switch to check the gender in 6th cell of ‘gender’ column.
If it’s ‘Male’, give a discount of 20% in ‘MonthlyCharges’
If it’s ‘Female’, give a discount of 50% in ‘MonthlyCharges’

4.	Use for loop to get the count of customers whose ‘InternetService’ is ‘DSL’

5.	Use while to find the number of customers whose tenure is exactly ‘2’ months

After this, Sam would be applying some inbuilt functions on the data to get some insights

**Questions on Inbuilt Functions:**

1.	Do these operations with the head() function:
1. a.	Get the first 4 records from ‘PhoneService’ column
1. b.	Get the first 8 records from ‘Contract’ column

2.	Do these operations with the tail() function:
2. a. Get the last record of ‘TotalCharges’ column
2. b. Get the last 5 records of ‘tenure’ column

3.	Find the average, minimum, maximum & range from the ‘tenure’ column

4.	Get 10 random values from the ‘TotalCharges’ column using sample()

5.	Find the count of different levels in ‘PaymentMethod’ & ‘Contract’ columns using table()","","Data Exploration using ""R"" Assignment Module 2","R- Assignment module 2","","0"

For safe and secure lending experience, it's important to analyze the past data. In this project, you have to build a deep learning model to predict the chance of default for future loans using the historical data. As you will see, this dataset is highly imbalanced and includes a lot of features that make this problem more challenging.

Objective: Create a model that predicts whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan using historical data.

Domain: Finance

Analysis to be done: Perform data preprocessing and build a deep learning prediction model.

Steps to be done: 

⦁    Load the dataset that is given to you
⦁    Check for null values in the dataset
⦁    Print percentage of default to payer of the dataset for the TARGET column
⦁    Balance the dataset if the data is imbalanced
⦁    Plot the balanced data or imbalanced data
⦁    Encode the columns that is required for the model
⦁    Calculate Sensitivity as a metrice
⦁    Calculate area under receiver operating characteristics curve","","House Loan Data Analysis","Deep Learning with Keras and Tensorflow","","5"

Defects or anomalies in industrially manufactured objects may produce a faulty or even dangerous final product. However, early detection of these defects is tedious and inaccurate because it is usually a manual work. For these reason an automated inspection would help to achieve higher production standards in the industry reducing costs and increasing productivity.

In this task defective or abnormal zones must be detected in the wooden objects. Image must be segmented detecting any anomaly in the texture in order to decide if the object is defective or not. As all the anomalies that might occur cannot be compiled, the task is presented in a one-class classification approach, where only non-defective textures are used in the training stage.

## Expected Submission
Submit a notebook that implements the full lifecycle of data preparation, model creation and evaluation.

With this model, a batch of  a batch of resulting image segmentation, binary masks, indicating the defective pixels / zones in the image should be produced as the masks provided in the dataset.

## Evaluation
Good solutions are capable of finding all the defective pixels without producing false positives. In order to evaluate this different measures might be used: ROC AUC at pixel level, precision at total recall and finally a precision-recall AUC.  The higher value in these metrics the better result.

As stated in the dataset two mask images are provided ""AND"" and ""XOR"". When evaluation only the ""AND"" pixels should be considered as positives while ""XOR"" pixels are ""optional"".","","Wood texture anomaly detection","One-Class classification","","0"

You have to write a code that gets the information from 8 different csv files and summarizes the information in another csv file that is attached as a sample. The sample output has the information for only two players, but you need to summarize the whole information.
II.
After summarizing the data into one csv file, you will use that file to answer the following question:
a. Choose the best 5 teams with a great transfer:
You will rank the players that had a different team in two seasons according to their new season ranking. Choose first 5 players and print their new team’s name.
b. Print the name of 5 best players that promoted themselves; in other words, the players whose rankings are increased in comparison to the last season will be sorted and first 5 players will be chosen. (If a player was not playing last year, he will not be included on the list).
c. Repeat the steps in part b, and print the name of the players that have demoted themselves.
d. Consider two formations: 3.5.2 and 4.4.2. There is an image attached to this file explaining these formations. Note that if a player is labeled as Defender, he can play in any post in the defense line. Similarly, a Midfielder and Forward can play in any position in the middle and front line, respectively. You are supposed to choose players according to these formations
based on their average scores in both seasons.
1) The best teams. (You are supposed to print two lists of size 11 with the highest average
ranking for both seasons).
2) The most offensive teams. (You are supposed to print two lists of size 11 with players
that have scored more goals; if there are more than one players with the same amount
of goals, choose the player that has played fewer minutes than the other players)
3) The fair play teams. (You are supposed to print two lists of size 11 with players the least fouls; if there are more than one options, choose the player that has player more
minutes than the other players.)
4) The youngest teams. (You are supposed to print two lists of size 11 with the youngest
ages; if there are more one options, choose the player with the higher ranking).

If ""parallel"" databases can be designed, there are quite a few interesting experiments to be done.
For example, make data of the same commands, but uttered by different automatic assistants. To what extent are algorithms able to distinguish mechanical sound from live speech?
Or build a database of the same commands in other languages. How similar are the same words in different languages on the spectrograms?

## Expected Submission
A database with 2-5 thousand sounds сould be a good result.

## Evaluation
Successful can be considered a classification that allows you to determine whether it is mechanical or live speech with an accuracy of over 90 percent.

Fake Reviews are often misleading. There are three parties who practice posting fake reviews on company online review platforms and they are: 

1. The company: When a company pumps fake reviews on a platform it is mostly positive. They rate themselves high and give themselves a great review to attract skilled labor and lure them.

2. The competitors: When competitors post fake reviews the nature of the review is mostly negative. They bully the target firm to mislead its potential skilled candidates. 

3. The Platform: No one likes to visit a platform with fewer reviews and hence it is a practice followed by the platforms to post fake reviews and attract other potential reviewers and consumers to engage on their platform. 

AmbitionBox is one such platform where one can find a lot of fake reviews. And especially some reviews might not be fake but they do not sound like a good review due to the lack of interest in elaborating.

This data repo contains two files: a train set where every review is a fake review. 
test set where most of the reviews are fake. 


Can you explore these datasets and figure out what reviews are fake or not fake, understand the nature of the fake review (positive, negative, neutral) and classify reviews as fake or not fake. Further classify the fake reviews as Competitor's Fake Reviews, Company's Fake Reviews, and platform's fake reviews (time series analysis should give you some information on when and how platform engages in posting fake reviews)?","","NLP Fake Company Reviews Classifier","Create a boolean field and tag fake and non-fake reviews","","0"

The task is to clean the data and transform it into a more readable format. Then just analyze the data.

Here are few things that you can do to analyze.

1. Write a regular expression to convert the data in a structured o/p (sample o/p shown below)
• Use the regular expression to read the data using pandas read_csv function.

2. Identify number of requests for each hour and plot the same using line plot. Use the following instructions
• Convert the data type of time column to datetime using pd.to_datetime() with appropriate time format
• Use resample function to identify number of requests per hour and plot the same using line plot
• Interpret the chart and identify from which hour of the day, the number of page visits increases

3. Identify different types of request_type along with their frequencies.

4. Analyze size column using the following instruction
• Convert size column to numeric (Remove special characters, if necessary)
• Using pd.cut, divide size column in to 10 bins.
• Identify the bin which has the maximum count

5. Using url column, create a new column file_type based on following conditions
• If the url ends with either .gif or .jpg, file_type will be image
• If the url ends with .html, file_type will be html
• Else file_type will be Other
• Identify how many times images were rendered","","Data cleaning, wrangling and analysis","","","0"

Case Study
You have just been hired as a Data Scientist by Gamma, one of the world leaders in the field of inspection, analysis, technical assistance and digital solutions to ensure the traceability, security and compliance of certain goods in the public and private sectors.
You are in charge of analyzing a source file, received from a partner, in order to detect potential fraudsters.
Your employee's mission is to ensure that the transportation of merchandise from a stopover point to the final customer has gone smoothly.
The process of loading the goods by the carrier is divided into the following steps:
 
The control concerns particularly two stages: number 2 and number 5.
During his usual audit process, your recruiter initiated a batch control. To do so, he checked the total weight of the goods coming from the import with the sum of the goods loaded by truck. He found a significant discrepancy.
 
In order to conduct a thorough investigation, your recruiter requested the data entered by his partner specializing in terminal and port dock operations. In return, he received a file containing the following fields:
- Num_escale : Number of the ship loaded with goods
- Num_vehicle : Number of the carrier
- Num_Trailer : Number of the trailer attached to the vehicle
- Customer_Number : Customer number
- Date_entrance : The date of the carrier's entry at the weighbridge
- Entry_Time : The time of the taking of the weight (empty) at the weighbridge
- Bridge_in : Number of the bridge at the entry
- Exit_bridge : Number of the weighbridge where the weight of the loaded truck was taken 
- Exit_Date: The date of the taking of the weight (loaded) at the bridge
- Exit_Time: The time of the weight pickup (loaded) at the bridge
- Empty_Weight:		The weight of the empty truck
- Weight_Loaded:	The weight of the truck loaded with the goods
- Product:		The merchandise
Your recruiter has identified a list of concerns:
- The truck did not position itself correctly 
- The carrier goes to a weighbridge for the empty weight measurement and changes the weighbridge for the loaded weight measurement
- The carrier hides heavy objects during the first empty weighing and gets rid of the weight or objects on the way to his load.
In order to highlight potential fraudsters. Your recruiter asks you to analyze the file received along the following lines:
1.	The minimum observed empty weight (including the driver) and the analysis of the distribution

2.	Identify the standard deviation per vehicle/trailer pair

3.	Propose a logical deviation: + 150 kg more than the observed minimum weight: we assume that the driver cannot come with an empty tank but with a minimum of fuel to drive. The maximum filling is 400 kg

4.	Propose classifications by standard deviation: Example:
a.	Black list: trucks coming with 2 times standard deviation
b.	Red list : trucks coming with 1 time standard deviation
c.	Yellow list : trucks coming with + 150 kg more than the observed minimum empty weight

5.	Waiting time between empty weight and fully loaded weight at exit 

6.	Analysis by destination

7.	Analysis by raw material

8.	Weighing at different weighbridges: entry at one weighbridge and exit at another: are trucks entering at different weighbridges susceptible to fraud?

9.	Seasonality analysis: 
a.	Difference per month
b.	Gap by Time Period: Morning, Afternoon, Evening
c.	Period before Covid (before March 16) and during Covid
10.	Using the machine learning technique, could you classify the carriers by risk level, in order to propose detailed controls on the risky carriers.","","Get Hired","Data Scientist","01/01/2022 23:59:00","1"

Credit Card Transactions are a rich and diverse data source. This particular synthetic dataset, consists of demographic and transaction details. Although the primary usage of this dataset has been for fraud detection, it would be interesting to mine this data and extract different trends and patterns.
The goal of this task is to showcase exploratory data analysis with visualizations that help in data understanding and trend identification.

## Expected Submission

A notebook providing in-depth analysis by making use of User, Card as well as Transaction data. The dataset consists of these separate csv files.
For reference, you can checkout different notebooks in the [Code section](https://www.kaggle.com/apoorvanitsureibm/credit-card-transactions-eda)

 The notebook should show:
-  Different visualizations to understand different attributes of the data
-  Statistical Analysis (Mean, Median, Mode, Correlation etc)
-  Trends Identification
-  Anything else you find interesting! 

It would be nice to see all intermediate steps and data preparation/ feature engineering methods employed as well.

## Evaluation

We will identify and recognize top submissions by the end of January 2022 based on the following criteria:

1. Engagement: How engaging is the submission? Would a viewer's interest be  
    maintained while going through the notebook? 
2. Simplicity: A good submission will ensure that different insights are presented in

Use a ML model to predicts the price of the used car using the dataset. You can use one currency or all of them depending on the approach you chose.
###Make Sure that:
1- For the same Make, Model, Submodel (or Make and Model) combination, the higher the number of miles, the lower the price for the same year.
2- For the same Make, Model, Submodel (or Make and Model) combination, the lower the year, the lower the price, do miles matter?
###Questions
1- How can you enforce monotonicity of year and/or mileage with respect to the price?
2- Predict the price of the car per each currency
3- Create visuals of price depreciation (price curve for same Make, Model, Submodel (or Make and Model) for different years)
4- What is the impact of submodel_id on price? Do you find a problem in the lack of values for this column?","","Used car prediction","","","0"

The intermittent nature and low control over the wind conditions bring up the same problem to every grid operator in their successful integration to satisfy current demand. In combination with having to predict demand and balance it with the supply, the grid operator now also must predict the availability of wind and solar generation plants in the next hour, day, or week. Apart from holding
back the benefits of renewable energy, incorrectly scheduling of wind generation plants may lead to unnecessary reservations, higher costs passed over to the consumer, and use of other more expensive and polluting power resources.
Working with real data is challenging due to noise and missing periods. 

## Dataset details
The provided full-year hourly time-series are simulated using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) software for a location in Texas, US. It has perfect data completeness, and no noisy data; challenges that hinder forecasting tasks with real datasets and distract from the goal.

The dataset contains various weather features which can be analyzed and used as predictors.

## Task Details
Predict the next day of power output = the next 24 steps ahead.

# Wind Turbine details
General Electric Wind Turbine installed onshore:
- Rotor diameter 111m 
- Rated output 3600kW
- Hub height 80m
- Single Wind Turbine

## Evaluation
A good solution will include a simple baseline and a more advanced forecasting approach. Visualization of both on the same graph will be ace!

Recommended evaluation metrics:
- Mean Error (Bias)
- Root Mean Sqare Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
- Correlation

You could think about ‘impact’ as a value that could help Jahanna Chronicle decide if the tweet could go viral. 
Chronicle’s data team has worked hard and prepared a dataset for you. They compiled the data and decided to share it via HTTP. So here is the link, directly from the Chronicle’s data team! 
Dataset: Attached as part of email
There are 15 features and 1 dependent variable (also called as the output variable; Here it is named as ‘impact’). 
Post Content - The text in the tweet
Sentiment score - Ranges from -20 to +20 (0 - neutral)
Post Length - The length of the tweet
Hashtag Count - The number of hashtags used in the tweet
Content URL Count - The number of URLs mentioned in the tweet
Tweet Count - The total number of tweets posted by the author of the tweet
Followers Count - The number of followers of the author of the post
Listed Count - the number of lists the post author is a part of
Media Type - The media type of the post (Text, image, video)
Published Datetime - The published time of the tweet
Mentions Count - The number of user mentions in the tweet
Post Author Verified - 1 if author is a verified user
Likes - Likes received for the tweet
Shares - Retweets received for the tweet
Comments - Number of comments for the tweet
For some weird reason, Chronicle’s engineering team is adamant that you explore modeling using a decision tree (with some form of boosting and pruning), neural network and linear regression but give the model that fits best. 
To summarize here are the tasks required by Jahanna Chronicle: 
● Give the model and code (by uploading it to a public repo) that can best predict the impact score 
● Prepare a report of not more than 6 pages of your findings of data. It should include analysis like the training and testing error rates you obtained running the various learning algorithms on your problems, graphs that show performance on both training and test data as a function of training size, Why did you get the results you did? How fast were they in terms of wall clock time? How much performance was due to the problems you were given? How about the values you chose for learning rates, stopping criteria, pruning methods, and so forth (and why doesn't your analysis show results for the different values you chose?)? Which algorithm performed best? How do you define best? Be creative and think of as many questions you can, and as many answers as you can. 
● All the code that was used to prepare a report (also by uploading it to a public repo)

Training an EfficientNetB0 using Tensorflow Keras, our trained model only achieved 13.42% accuracy on the training set and 11.32% on the validation set after 24 epochs of training. Yet, it produces features competitive to ImageNet on transfer tasks. 

Given the correlation between ImageNet validation set accuracy and transfer accuracy, it is of interest to see how far model optimization can improve transfer accuracy.

Recent research from Google has pointed that sometimes more classes is not always better for transfer learning. In particular, they show that pretraining on a portion of ImageNet  (more similar to the target dataset) improves transfer accuracy. Read more [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.07056.pdf).

Given an arbitrary biological image dataset (e.g. mechanism of action classification), we would like to test if pretraining on labels from a related category (e.g. phenotype) can yield more distinctive features than features from pretraining on all labels.

## Expected Submission 
This requires the user to find a relevant biological image dataset, and choose a category label most relevant. After which, they will need to train models on labels from the relevant category, and evaluate the performance of the category-specific model and the all-category model.

The company changed its name to Infosys Technologies Private Limited in April 1992 and to Infosys Technologies Limited when it became a public limited company in June 1992. It was later renamed to Infosys Limited in June 2011.

An initial public offering (IPO) was floated in February 1993 with an offer price of ₹95 (equivalent to ₹580 or US$7.80 in 2020) per share against a book value of ₹20 (equivalent to ₹120 or US$1.60 in 2020) per share. The IPO was undersubscribed but it was ""bailed out"" by US investment bank Morgan Stanley, which picked up a 13% equity stake at the offer price. Its shares were listed in June 1993 with trading opening at ₹145 (equivalent to ₹890 or US$12 in 2020) per share.

Infosys shares were listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in 1999 as American depositary receipts. It became the first Indian company to be listed on Nasdaq. The share price surged to ₹8,100 (equivalent to ₹30,000 or US$390 in 2020) by 1999 making it the costliest share on the market at the time. At that time, Infosys was among the 20 biggest companies by market capitalization on the Nasdaq. The ADR listing was shifted from Nasdaq to NYSE Euronext to give European investors better access to the company's shares.

On 28 July 2010, the then British Prime Minister David Cameron visited Infosys HQ in Bangalore and addressed Infosys employees. Infosys, Bangalore, Its annual revenue reached US$100 million in 1999, US$1 billion in 2004 and US$10 billion in 2017.

In 2012, Infosys announced a new office in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to serve Harley-Davidson, being the 18th international office in the United States. Infosys hired 1,200 United States employees in 2011, and expanded the workforce by an additional 2,000 employees in 2012. In April 2018 Infosys announced expanding in Indianapolis, Indiana. The development will include more than 120 acres and is expected to result in 3,000 new jobs—1,000 more than previously announced.

In July 2014, Infosys started a product subsidiary called EdgeVerve Systems, focusing on enterprise software products for business operations, customer service, procurement and commerce network domains. In August 2015, the Finacle Global Banking Solutions assets were officially transferred from Infosys and became part of the product company EdgeVerve Systems product portfolio.

Everyone knows the headache of a flight delay - but can we know if a flight WILL be delayed? An airline will tell you it's due to the weather, the airport, etc and not under their control. If this is the case, then flight delays should be reliably predicted using only measurable, external factors. If flight delays cannot be predicted from this information, is it possible that the error lies within the carrier's control?

## Expected Submission
Submit a notebook with a predictive model that predicts flight delays. Can flight delays be predicted from the features in this dataset, or is more data needed?

Medicine students may be faced with this type of dataset at some point. In a hospital database one can access the time between a patient received its diagnose until it went into surgery, and also all the complications that happened during this time.

## Expected Submission
Either a report detailing the strategy used to solve this problem, or a general conceptualization of how to solve it.

## Evaluation
One should expect the predictive power to be small given the data has been generated randomly, and that there is only one predictor. The real challenge here is in finding a method that can deal with multiclass prediction when the classes are not multually exclusive. 

### Further help
I suspect that this problem would be solvable with NN, however the dataset is much too small for that. Other solutions might involve recoding the classes taking into consideration their possible combinations, or even dropping the non-multually exclusive cases, with the right argumentation they could all be valid means of solving this issue.","","Predict complications based on time from diagnose to surgery","Many complications may happen simultaneously, however there is only one predictor.

The Opioid Epidemic has entered a new phase with a resumed increase in overdoses coming from the job loss and social isolation resulting from the Coronavirus Pandemic. This is happening even as we have begun to turn the corner on the opioid over-prescription that started in the 1990s.

**Expected Submission**
Analyse the trends over time by State both for the overall overdose deaths and for the deaths per drug type. Submissions should focus heavily on data visualisation since there is a very strong regional component to the epidemic.

Notebooks should show the trends in different States over time as well has how different regions of the United States have fared over time.

**Evaluation**
This is not a formal competition, but rather an on going project.

In other words, do these texts affect investors in their decision to invest in a project or not.

In rhetorics, based on Aristotle, there are three appeals, Pathos, signals which appeal to emotions, Logos, which appeals to logic, and Ethos, which signals credibility.

I have uploaded 4 different word lists, positive and negative words which I brought from Diction word lists which are really popular among researchers. In addition,  I created two separate word lists for Ethos and Logos appeals which are gathered by assessing the texts of risks disclosures for 1700 projects manually.

You work for Spark Funds, an asset management company. Spark Funds wants to make investments in a few companies. The CEO of Spark Funds wants to understand the global trends in investments so that she can take the investment decisions effectively.

 

Business and Data Understanding
Spark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:

It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment

It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in

For your analysis, consider a country to be English speaking only if English is one of the official languages in that country

You may use this list: Click here for a list of countries where English is an official language.

 

These conditions will give you sufficient information for your initial analysis. Before getting to specific questions, let’s understand the problem and the data first.

 

1. What is the strategy?

Spark Funds wants to invest where most other investors are investing. This pattern is often observed among early stage startup investors.

 

2. Where did we get the data from? 

We have taken real investment data from crunchbase.com, so the insights you get may be incredibly useful. For this assignment, we have divided the data into the following files:

 

You have to use three main data tables for the entire analysis (available for download on the next page):

 

3. What is Spark Funds’ business objective?

The business objectives and goals of data analysis are pretty straightforward.

Business objective: The objective is to identify the best sectors, countries, and a suitable investment type for making investments. The overall strategy is to invest where others are investing, implying that the 'best' sectors and countries are the ones 'where most investors are investing'.
Goals of data analysis: Your goals are divided into three sub-goals:
Investment type analysis: Comparing the typical investment amounts in the venture, seed, angel, private equity etc. so that Spark Funds can choose the type that is best suited for their strategy.
Country analysis: Identifying the countries which have been the most heavily invested in the past. These will be Spark Funds’ favourites as well.
Sector analysis: Understanding the distribution of investments across the eight main sectors. (Note that we are interested in the eight 'main sectors' provided in the mapping file. The two files — companies and rounds2 — have numerous sub-sector names; hence, you will need to map each sub-sector to its main sector.)
 

4. How do you approach the assignment? What are the deliverables?

The entire assignment is divided into checkpoints to help you navigate. For each checkpoint, you are advised to fill in the tables into the spreadsheet provided in the download segment. The tables are also mentioned under the 'Results Expected' section after each checkpoint. Since this is the first assignment, you have been provided with some additional guidance. Going forward you will be expected to structure and solve the problem by yourself, just like you would be solving problems in real life scenarios.

 

Important Note: All your code has to be submitted in one Jupyter notebook. For every checkpoint, keep writing code in one well-commented Jupyter notebook which you can submit at the end.","","Investment Assignment","","","0"

You work for Spark Funds, an asset management company. Spark Funds wants to make investments in a few companies. The CEO of Spark Funds wants to understand the global trends in investments so that she can take the investment decisions effectively.

 

Business and Data Understanding
Spark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:

It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment

It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in

For your analysis, consider a country to be English speaking only if English is one of the official languages in that country

You may use this list: Click here for a list of countries where English is an official language.

 

These conditions will give you sufficient information for your initial analysis. Before getting to specific questions, let’s understand the problem and the data first.

 

1. What is the strategy?

Spark Funds wants to invest where most other investors are investing. This pattern is often observed among early stage startup investors.

 

2. Where did we get the data from? 

We have taken real investment data from crunchbase.com, so the insights you get may be incredibly useful. For this assignment, we have divided the data into the following files:

I am mandated to determine how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently with the aim of converting casual riders into annual member.  

**Key stakeholders**:      
Lily Moreno: The director of marketing,    
Cyclistic executive team and  
Cyclistic marketing analytics team.    
                          
### Ask Phase
By the end of this project, i should be able to determine how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently, Why casual riders would want to buy Cyclistic annual memberships and how Cyclistic can use digital media to influence casual riders to become members.

#### Tools Used for this project.

Excel, SQL and R-Language

### Prepare Phase
The datasets being used for the project are 12 months of trip data owned by Motivate International Inc who have granted me a non-exclusive, royalty-free, limited, perpetual license to access, reproduce, analyze, copy, modify, distribute in my product or service and use the Data for any lawful purpose (“License”).  

There are no issues of bias or credibility with these datasets. They are Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current and Cited.  

Upon initial inspection of each of the 12 csv datasets using ISBLANK function in excel, i noticed that some of the observations are missing. This i will address subsequently using RStudio.
                     
### Loading Datasets

Loading the needed 12 csv datasets, i will first load the tidyverse package which contains most of the dataframe manipulation packages needed 
for loading and cleaning the datasets for this project.","","Google Project","","","0"

Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

 

In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

El correo electronico es una de las herramientas mas antiguas y utiles que nacieron con
internet y a pesar de que han surgido nuevo metodos de comunicacion, hoy en dıa, el correo
electronico es ampliamente utilizado debido a la versatilidad en la transmision del mensaje, sin
embargo, tambien ha traıdo consigo una serie de problemas importantes, siendo dos de ellos,
el aumento de trafico de la red y el robo de identidad debido a correos electronicos de caracter
malicioso llamados correos spam.
## 1.1. Motivacion o justificacion
La identificacion de spam hasta la fecha sigue siendo un reto, esto es debido a que no es
facil identificar un correo de este tipo, pues existe una gran variedad y cada vez son mas, que
es muy difıcil distinguir entre un correo organico y uno spam. Los modelos de aprendizaje automatico han mostrado un gran desempe˜no en la deteccion de estos correos, y en este trabajo
abordaremos algunos aspectos clave antes de iniciar con el modelo, esto es, el conjunto de datos
y su preprocesamiento.
## 1.2. Planteamiento del problema
El conjunto de datos del cual se extraera un subset es el correspondiente un subset de la base
de datos “Enron Email Dataset”. Contiene datos de alrededor de 150 usuarios con un total de
alrededor de 500,000 mensajes de correo electronico. Originalmente el dataset se hizo publico
por la Comision Federal Regulatoria de Energıa de Estados Unidos durante la investigacion
alrededor del colapso de la empresa Enron.
El subconjunto a utilizar consta de 5,854 correos, de los cuales 1,496 estan catalogados como
spam y el resto corresponden a correos electronicos legıtimos.
### 1.3. Objetivo de la investigacion
El objetivo de este trabajo es lograr clasificar de manera efectiva estos correos electronicos
reconociendo patrones en el texto para poder identificar si es spam o un correo legıtimo.
## 1.4. Descripcion del conjunto de datos
El conjunto de datos a utilizar es el correspondiente a la base de datos “Enron Email
Dataset”. Contiene datos de alrededor de 150 usuarios con un total de alrededor de 500,000
mensajes de correo electronico. Originalmente el dataset se hizo publico por la Comision Federal
Regulatoria de Energıa de Estaos Unidos durante la investigacion alrededor del colapso de la
empresa Enron.

The purpose of this study was to develop a deep learning algorithm that can differentiate benign and malignant bone lesions using MR.

#1. Imaging data models
Models for image classification should be developed by adapting the EfficientNet or any other model deep learning architecture.  final classification layer with a single node and sigmoid activation need to used for perform the binary classification task.

#2. Clinical data model
A logistic regression model using clinical variables was separately developed for the classification task. Inputs were patient age, sex, and lesion location. 21 locations (clavicle, cranium, proximal femur, distal femur, foot, proximal radius, distal radius, proximal ulna, distal,ulna, hand, hip, proximal humerus, distal humerus, proximal tibia, distal tibia, proximal fibula, distal fibula, mandible, rib/chest wall, scapula, or spine) were one-hot encoded such that the model
received 23 distinct quantified input variables.

#3.Ensemble model
The imaging and clinical feature models need to be combine by using a stacked ensemble approach in which a voting ensemble received malignancy probabilities from the imaging and clinical feature models as inputs and created outputs based upon a summation of the predicted probabilities. Each ensemble classification model consisted of the outputs of a model trained upon T1W imaging studies, a model trained upon T2W imaging studies, and a logistic regression model based upon clinical features.","","Bone_tumor_predicted","Deep Learning for Classification of Bone Lesions on Routine MRI","10/10/2021 23:59:00","0"

Exercise 2: Assigning Locations [20 Marks]
ValueBuild Constructions Inc. has to build n ∈ N different types of factories, one at each of the n
locations. The cost of constructing (setup cost) the i
th facility at the j
th location provided in the
Table 2 below. ValueBuild Constructions Inc. wants to minimize the sum of the costs of assigning
all the facilities to the locations.

 [R] Write a mathematical model to solve the assignment problem explained above. Define all
the variables and constraints clearly. Use appropriate notations and define appropriate sets
to be used in your optimization problem.
2. Construct a pyomo model for this problem for a general n. You can assume that the cost
matrix is given as data from a txt file and can be loaded as a numpy array.
3. Use the data in Table 2 to make a .txt file for your model. You can use the setupcosts.txt
file uploaded in Moodle to create the .txt file. Name the file as lab5 ex2.txt.
4. Copy the file to colab environment.
5. Use numpy.loadtxt to load the data from lab5 ex2.txt file into a numpy array.
6. Adapt the general pyomo model you created, to use the data loaded from the lab5 ex2.txt
file.
7. Use cbc solver to solve your optimization problem. In your code, remember to specify which
variables are integers.
8. [R] Solve the problem and report which facility must be opened at each location.
9. [R] Now change the integer variables in your model to continuous variables, and re-solve the
problem. Report the solution (only the non-zero values of the solution).
10. [R] Are the optimal costs for both problems same? Are the values of the variables still
integer-valued? If yes, explain why.
11. Will the solution to the continuous problem become fractional (non-integer) if the costs are
changed to non-integer values? Try changing the costs to different values and test whether
the solution to the LP becomes fractional for any of them.","","Bala sir lab 5","IITB","09/30/2021 23:59:00","0"

will be working with a specified dataset of images.  You will then explore the data and try the statistical learning approaches that we have covered in this course to tackle the task associated with the dataset.  The statistical approaches should cover both conventional machine learning (i.e. not deep learning), from the first half of the unit, and deep learning from the second half.  Which methods you choose are (mostly) entirely up to you; a goal of the project is for you to explore the approaches you've been taught, or perhaps beyond those, in order to build a high-performing system.

We're specifying an image dataset as this is one of the types of data to which deep learning has been most extensively applied, as in the MNIST dataset used as a running example in the Geron textbook.

The image dataset will have an associated classification task.  The goal of your statistical learning approaches is to build models that will perform well on that classification task.  To evaluate how well you do, we'll be using both a public test set and a private test set.  You'll have access to the public test set for the whole duration of the project, so you can see how well your system is performing.  The private test set, which will only be released at the end of semester for a limited period, is to see how well your system generalises to an unseen dataset.

Project Task
For this, you'll be working with a dataset of human faces.  Your task is to predict the age group of the person whose face is in the image.  
We expect that, by default, you'll be developing your solutions under Google Colab.  Images are relatively large data items, so we've produced a cut-down version of the dataset that should not cause any problems with Colab's memory limits.  It's cut down both in terms of image size, and number of items in the dataset.  This reduced dataset is available in Kaggle, although you can use whatever data you like to train your model.  We also make available a devset that's separate from the training set.

For testing, there'll be a public test set and a private test set.  The private test set will be released for a limited time in the last week of class.

Special Features
While you are mostly free to explore different conventional machine learning and deep learning methods, there are two things that you are expected to try during your exploration:

HOG features.  This will apply only to conventional ML.  It is possible to just use the raw data as input to a conventional ML, as the textbook does in Ch 3.  However, image processing has a long history of extracting useful features that help with the relatively high dimensionality of the input, such as HOG features.  You can read about these in another OReilly book, Hands-On Image Processing with Python by Sandipan Dey (chapter ""Extracting Image Features and Descriptors""), which you can access via the OReilly website in the same way as the textbook.  You do not have to use these features as input with all your attempts using conventional ML, but should use them for at least one.
Multiple instances of images of the same person.  In this dataset, you will see that the label of each image contains an ID of the person in that image, and that in general you may have multiple images of a particular person.  In at least one of your models, you should take this into account.  (You can take it into account in, for example, a post-processing step, aggregating the predictions for all of the images with the same ID.)


As noted in the project Description, you'll be working with a dataset of human faces.  The images have dimensionality 100x100, and are (mostly) colour.

The data is split into train_images.npy, val_images.npy and test_images.npy, with a test_private_images.npy to come later.  Labels are also available for the training data and validation data, in train_labels.npy and val_labels.npy respectively.  (npy files are a standard format for files using numpy.)  

The labels have the form x-y, where

x is an identifier specific to an individual; and
y is the part of the label that corresponds to age.
As an example, the label 12726-37 corresponds to a person who is 37 years old, with ID 12726.  (This happens to be the second person in the devset, the actor Gabrielle Anwar.)

The ages fall into 3 groups: ages 6-20, 35-40, and 55-98.  There can be multiple images of the same person: there are several images of Gabrielle Anwar, ID 12726.  The dataset is a noisy one, scraped from the web, so not all the images that should be of the same person, with the same ID, are in fact of that person.  (The ninth image in the devset, which also has ID 12726, is of another actor from the series Burn Notice that Gabrielle Anwar was a lead actor in.)  In the provided dataset, it is guaranteed that all of the images with a particular ID will be in the same age group","","Minstum","","10/29/2021 23:59:00","0"

The dataset comes from a service from which anyone present on the French territory benefits without social, cultural or administrative distinction (with or without papers). Nationalities have only been inferred from individuals' last names.

## Task Details
The text below is based on an article from the French Observatory for Immigration and Demography entitled: [The « Great Replacement »: Fantasy or Reality?](https://observatoire-immigration.fr/grand-remplacement/) 
The notion of «&nbsp;great replacement » in France now haunts editorials, social networks and major audiovisual media platforms, but places of power and simple family discussions.
The importance of migratory flows, coupled with the birth rate of immigrants or of immigrant origin, resulted in 11% of the population residing in France being immigrant in 2017 and 25% being of immigrant origin - counting children of the second generation from immigration - according to figures from the French Office for Immigration and Integration (OFII) published in October 2018. This represents a quarter of the French population. And these are all stocks - that is, what is and not what will be in the future, as a result of migratory flows and future births.
However, it is necessary to take into account the fertility differential between women descending from indigenous peoples (less than 1.8 children per woman on average in 2017), women descending from immigrants (2.02 children per woman on average) and immigrant women (2.73 children per woman on average). This fertility varies greatly according to the origin of the women: 3.6 children per woman on average for Algerian immigrants, 3.5 children per woman for Tunisian immigrants, 3.4 children per woman for Moroccan immigrants and 3.1 children per woman for Turkish immigrants, which is higher than the fertility of their country of origin (respectively 3; 2.4; 2.2; 2.1).
Over the same twenty-year period, between 1998 and 2018: 
    • The number of births to children with both French parents fell by 13.7%. 
    • The number of births of children with at least one foreign parent increased by 63.6% 
    • The number of births to children with both foreign parents increased by 43%. 
In 2018, almost a third of children born (31.4%) had at least one parent born abroad.
While a part of the French political class remains in denial about this phenomenon and its consequences, officials in other countries source of immigration, have openly claimed this contemporary mode of conquest since the 70s: 1974, former Algerian President Houari Boumedienne said in a U.N. speech: “One day, millions of men will leave the Southern Hemisphere to go to the Northern Hemisphere. And they will not go there as friends. The wombs of our women will give us victory.” A precisely anti-France hatred is even cultivated by certain African states for which France happens to be the perfect scapegoat for the failure of their successive policies. For Algeria, this hatred even goes so far as to be included in its national anthem (cf. [[Wikipedia] National anthem of Algeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kassaman)).
