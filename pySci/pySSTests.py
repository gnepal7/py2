# SciPy Statistical Significance Tests

# SciPy provides us with a module called scipy.stats, which has functions for performing 
# statistical significance tests.

# Hypothesis in Statistics
# Hypothesis is an assumption about a parameter in population.

# Null Hypothesis
# It assumes that the observation is not statistically significant.

# Alternate Hypothesis
# It assumes that the observations are due to some reason.
# It's alternate to Null Hypothesis.

# Example:
# For an assessment of a student we would take:
# "student is worse than average" - as a null hypothesis, and:
# "student is better than average" - as an alternate hypothesis.

# One tailed test
# When our hypothesis is testing for one side of the value only, it is 
# called "one tailed test".
# Example:
# For the null hypothesis:
# "the mean is equal to k", we can have alternate hypothesis:
# "the mean is less than k", or:
# "the mean is greater than k"

# Two tailed test
# When our hypothesis is testing for both side of the values.
# Example:
# For the null hypothesis:
# "the mean is equal to k", we can have alternate hypothesis:
# "the mean is not equal to k"
# In this case the mean is less than, or greater than k, and both sides are to be checked.

# Alpha value
# Alpha value is the level of significance.
# Example:
# How close to extremes the data must be for null hypothesis to be rejected.
# It is usually taken as 0.01, 0.05, or 0.1.

# P value
# P value tells how close to extreme the data actually is.
# P value and alpha values are compared to establish the statistical significance.
# If p value <= alpha we reject the null hypothesis and say that the data is 
# statistically significant. otherwise we accept the null hypothesis.

# T-Test
# T-tests are used to determine if there is significant deference between means 
# of two variables and lets us know if they belong to the same distribution.
# It is a two tailed test.
# The function ttest_ind() takes two samples of same size and produces a tuple 
# of t-statistic and p-value.

# Find if the given values v1 and v2 are from same distribution:
# import numpy as np
# from scipy.stats import ttest_ind
# v1 = np.random.normal(size=100)
# v2 = np.random.normal(size=100)
# # res = ttest_ind(v1, v2)
# res = ttest_ind(v1, v2).pvalue
# print(res)


# KS-Test
# KS test is used to check if given values follow a distribution.
# The function takes the value to be tested, and the CDF as two parameters.
# A CDF can be either a string or a callable function that returns the probability.
# It can be used as a one tailed or two tailed test.
# By default it is two tailed. We can pass parameter alternative as a string of 
# one of two-sided, less, or greater.

# Example
# Find if the given value follows the normal distribution:
# import numpy as np
# from scipy.stats import kstest
# v = np.random.normal(size=100)
# res = kstest(v, 'norm')
# print(res)

# Statistical Description of Data
# In order to see a summary of values in an array, we can use the describe() function.
# It returns the following description:
    # number of observations (nobs)
    # minimum and maximum values = minmax
    # mean
    # variance
    # skewness
    # kurtosis

# Example
# Show statistical description of the values in an array:
# import numpy as np
# from scipy.stats import describe
# v = np.random.normal(size=100)
# res = describe(v)
# print(res)


# Normality Tests (Skewness and Kurtosis)
# Normality tests are based on the skewness and kurtosis.
# The normaltest() function returns p value for the null hypothesis:
# "x comes from a normal distribution".

# Skewness:
# A measure of symmetry in data.
# For normal distributions it is 0.
# If it is negative, it means the data is skewed left.
# If it is positive it means the data is skewed right.

# Kurtosis:
# A measure of whether the data is heavy or lightly tailed to a normal distribution.
# Positive kurtosis means heavy tailed.
# Negative kurtosis means lightly tailed.

# Example
# Find skewness and kurtosis of values in an array:
# import numpy as np
# from scipy.stats import skew, kurtosis
# v = np.random.normal(size=100)
# print(skew(v))
# print(kurtosis(v)) 

# Find if the data comes from a normal distribution:
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import normaltest
v = np.random.normal(size=100)
print(normaltest(v))
