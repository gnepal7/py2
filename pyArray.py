# Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, # but Python Lists 
# can be used instead

# Arrays are used to store multiple values in one single variable

# Access the Elements of an Array
group = ["Gopal", "Samana", "Bimarsha", "Sunlight", "Ragen", "Narendra"]
# print(group[0])
# Modify the value of the first array item
# group[0] = "Ishwor"
# print(group[0])
# The Length of an Array
# l = len(group)
# print(l)
# Looping Array Elements
# for s in group:
#     print(s)

# Adding Array Elements
# Add one more element to the cars array
# group.append("Sandip")
# for y in group:
#     print(y)

# Removing Array Elements
# Delete the second element of the cars array
# group.pop(1)

# You can also use the remove() method to remove an element from the array
group.remove("Bimarsha")
print(group)
# The list's remove() method only removes the first occurrence of the specified value
