# Rayleigh Distribution
# Rayleigh distribution is used in signal processing.
# It has two parameters:
# scale - (standard deviation) decides how flat the distribution will be default 1.0).
# size - The shape of the returned array

# Draw out a sample for rayleigh distribution with scale of 2 with size 2x3:
from numpy import random
x = random.rayleigh(scale=2, size=(2, 3))
print(x) 

# Visualization of Rayleigh Distribution
from numpy import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
sns.displot(random.rayleigh(size=100), kind="kde")
plt.show() 

# Similarity Between Rayleigh and Chi Square Distribution
# At unit stddev and 2 degrees of freedom rayleigh and chi square represent 
# the same distributions
