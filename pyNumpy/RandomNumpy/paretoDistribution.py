# Pareto Distribution
# A distribution following Pareto's law i.e. 80-20 distribution 
# (20% factors cause 80% outcome).
# It has two parameter:
# a - shape parameter.
# size - The shape of the returned array.

# Draw out a sample for pareto distribution with shape of 2 with size 2x3:
from numpy import random
x = random.pareto(a=2, size=(2, 3))
print(x) 

# Visualization of Pareto Distribution
from numpy import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
sns.displot(random.pareto(a=9, size=100))
plt.show()
