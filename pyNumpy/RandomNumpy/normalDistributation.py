# Normal Distribution
# It is also called the Gaussian Distribution after the German 
# mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss

# Use the random.normal() method to get a Normal Data Distribution.
# It has three parameters:
# loc - (Mean) where the peak of the bell exists.
# scale - (Standard Deviation) how flat the graph distribution should be.
# size - The shape of the returned array.

# Generate a random normal distribution of size 2x3
# from numpy import random
# x = random.normal(size=(2, 3))
# print(x) 

# Generate a random normal distribution of size 2x3 with mean at 1 
# and standard deviation of 2
# from numpy import random
# x = random.normal(loc=1, scale=2, size=(2, 3))
# print(x) 

# Visualization of Normal Distribution
from numpy import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
sns.displot(random.normal(size=1000), kind="kde")
plt.show() 

# Note: The curve of a Normal Distribution is also known as the Bell 
# Curve because of the bell-shaped curve.
