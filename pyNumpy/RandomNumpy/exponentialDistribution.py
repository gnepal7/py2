# Exponential Distribution
# Exponential distribution is used for describing time till next event 
# e.g. failure/success etc.
# It has two parameters:
# scale - inverse of rate ( see lam in poisson distribution ) defaults to 1.0.
# size - The shape of the returned array.

# Draw out a sample for exponential distribution with 2.0 scale with 2x3 size:
# from numpy import random
# x = random.exponential(scale=3, size=(2, 3))
# print(x) 

# Visualization of Exponential Distribution
from numpy import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
sns.displot(random.exponential(size=1000), kind="kde")
plt.show() 

# Relation Between Poisson and Exponential Distribution
# Poisson distribution deals with number of occurences of an event in a time 
# period whereas exponential distribution deals with the time between these events.
